# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Words of Amos — who hath been among herdsmen of Tekoa — that he hath seen concerning Israel, in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the shaking;

<sup>2</sup> and he saith: Jehovah from Zion doth roar, And from Jerusalem giveth forth His voice, And mourned have pastures of the shepherds, And withered hath the top of Carmel!

<sup>3</sup> And thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Damascus, And for four, I do not reverse it, Because of their threshing Gilead with sharp-pointed irons,

<sup>4</sup> And I have sent a fire against the house of Hazael, And it hath consumed the palaces of Ben-Hadad.

<sup>5</sup> And I have broken the bar of Damascus, And cut off the inhabitant from Bikat-Aven, And a holder of a sceptre from Beth-Eden, And removed have been the people of Aram to Kir, said Jehovah.

<sup>6</sup> Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Gaza, And for four, I do not reverse it, Because of their removing a complete captivity, To deliver up to Edom,

<sup>7</sup> And I have sent a fire against the wall of Gaza, And it hath consumed her palaces;

<sup>8</sup> And I have cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, And a holder of a sceptre from Ashkelon, And have turned back My hand against Ekron, And perished have the remnant of the Philistines, Said the Lord Jehovah.

<sup>9</sup> Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Tyre, And for four, I do not reverse it, Because of their delivering up a complete captivity to Edom, And they remembered not the brotherly covenant,

<sup>10</sup> And I have sent a fire against the wall of Tyre, And it hath consumed her palaces.

<sup>11</sup> Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of Edom, And for four, I do not reverse it, Because of his pursuing with a sword his brother, And he hath destroyed his mercies, And tear perpetually doth his anger, And his wrath — he hath kept it for ever,

<sup>12</sup> And I have sent a fire against Teman, And it hath consumed palaces of Bozrah.

<sup>13</sup> Thus said Jehovah: For three transgressions of the sons of Ammon, And for four, I do not reverse it, Because of their ripping up the pregnant ones of Gilead, To enlarge their border,

<sup>14</sup> And I have kindled a fire against the wall of Rabbah, And it hath consumed her palaces, With a shout in a day of battle, With a whirlwind in a day of hurricane,

<sup>15</sup> And gone hath their king in a removal, He and his heads together, said Jehovah!
