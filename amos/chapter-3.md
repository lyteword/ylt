# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> Hear ye this word that Jehovah hath spoken concerning you, O sons of Israel, concerning all the family that I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying:

<sup>2</sup> Only you I have known of all families of the land, Therefore I charge on you all your iniquities.

<sup>3</sup> Do two walk together if they have not met?

<sup>4</sup> Roar doth a lion in a forest and prey he hath none? Give out doth a young lion his voice from his habitation, If he hath not caught?

<sup>5</sup> Doth a bird fall into a snare of the earth, And there is no gin for it? Doth a snare go up from the ground, And prey it captureth not?

<sup>6</sup> Is a trumpet blown in a city, And do people not tremble? Is there affliction in a city, And Jehovah hath not done [it]?

<sup>7</sup> For the Lord Jehovah doth nothing, Except He hath revealed His counsel unto His servants the prophets.

<sup>8</sup> A lion hath roared — who doth not fear? The Lord Jehovah hath spoken — who doth not prophesy?

<sup>9</sup> Sound ye unto palaces in Ashdod, And to palaces in the land of Egypt, and say: Be ye gathered on mountains of Samaria, And see many troubles within her, And oppressed ones in her midst.

<sup>10</sup> And they have not known to act straightforwardly, An affirmation of Jehovah, Who are treasuring up violence and spoil in their palaces.

<sup>11</sup> Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: An adversary — and surrounding the land, And he hath brought down from thee thy strength, And spoiled have been thy palaces.

<sup>12</sup> Thus said Jehovah: As the shepherd delivereth from the lion's mouth Two legs, or a piece of an ear, So delivered are the sons of Israel, Who are sitting in Samaria on the corner of a bed, And in Damascus [on that of] a couch.

<sup>13</sup> Hear ye and testify to the house of Jacob, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah, God of Hosts.

<sup>14</sup> For in the day of My charging the transgressions of Israel on him, I have laid a charge on the altars of Beth-El, And cut off have been the horns of the altar, And they have fallen to the earth.

<sup>15</sup> And I have smitten the winter-house with the summer-house, And perished have houses of ivory, And consumed have been many houses, An affirmation of Jehovah!
