# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> The burden of a word of Jehovah unto Israel by the hand of Malachi:

<sup>2</sup> I have loved you, said Jehovah, And ye have said, 'In what hast Thou loved us?'

<sup>3</sup> Is not Esau Jacob's brother? — an affirmation of Jehovah, And I love Jacob, and Esau I have hated, And I make his mountains a desolation, And his inheritance for dragons of a wilderness.

<sup>4</sup> Because Edom saith, 'We have been made poor, And we turn back and we build the wastes,' Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: They do build, and I do destroy, And [men] have called to them, 'O region of wickedness,' 'O people whom Jehovah defied to the age.'

<sup>5</sup> And your eyes do see, and ye say, 'Magnified is Jehovah beyond the border of Israel,

<sup>6</sup> A son honoureth a father, and a servant his master. And if I [am] a father, where [is] Mine honour? And if I [am] a master, where [is] My fear? Said Jehovah of Hosts to you, O priests, despising My name! And ye have said: 'In what have we despised Thy name?'

<sup>7</sup> Ye are bringing nigh on Mine altar polluted bread, And ye have said: 'In what have we polluted Thee?' In your saying: 'The table of Jehovah — it [is] despicable,'

<sup>8</sup> And when ye bring nigh the blind for sacrifice, 'There is no evil,' And when ye bring nigh the lame and sick, 'There is no evil;' Bring it near, I pray thee, to thy governor — Doth he accept thee? or doth he lift up thy face? Said Jehovah of Hosts.

<sup>9</sup> And now, appease, I pray thee, the face of God, And He doth favour us; From your own hand hath this been, Doth He accept of you appearances? Said Jehovah of Hosts.

<sup>10</sup> Who [is] even among you, And he shutteth the two-leaved doors? Yea, ye do not kindle Mine altar for nought, I have no pleasure in you, said Jehovah of Hosts, And a present I do not accept of your hand.

<sup>11</sup> For, from the rising of the sun to its going in, Great [is] My name among nations, And in every place perfume is brought nigh to My name, and a pure present, For great [is] My name among nations, Said Jehovah of Hosts.

<sup>12</sup> And ye are polluting it in your saying, 'The table of Jehovah — it is polluted, As to its fruit — despicable is its food.'

<sup>13</sup> And ye have said, 'Lo, what a weariness,' And ye have puffed at it, said Jehovah of Hosts, And ye have brought in plunder, And the lame and the sick, And ye have brought in the present! Do I accept it from your hand? said Jehovah.

<sup>14</sup> And cursed [is] a deceiver, who hath in his drove a male, And is vowing, and is sacrificing a marred thing to the Lord, For a great king [am] I, said Jehovah of Hosts, And My name [is] revered among nations!
