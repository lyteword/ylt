# 1 Chronicles 16 

**¹** And they bring in the ark of God, and set it up in the midst of the tent that David hath stretched out for it, and they bring near burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God;

**²** and David ceaseth from offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, and blesseth the people in the name of Jehovah,

**³** and giveth a portion to every man of Israel, both man and woman: to each a cake of bread, and a measure of wine, and a grape-cake.

**⁴** And he putteth before the ark of Jehovah, of the Levites, ministers, even to make mention of, and to thank, and to give praise to Jehovah, God of Israel,

**⁵** Asaph the head, and his second Zechariah; Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, with instruments of psalteries, and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals is sounding;

**⁶** and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests [are] with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.

**⁷** On that day then hath David given at the beginning to give thanks to Jehovah by the hand of Asaph and his brethren: —

**⁸** Give thanks to Jehovah, call in His name, Make known among the peoples His doings.

**⁹** Sing ye to Him, sing psalms to Him, Meditate on all His wonders.

**¹⁰** Boast yourselves in His holy name, Rejoice doth the heart of those seeking Jehovah.

**¹¹** Seek ye Jehovah and His strength, Seek His face continually.

**¹²** Remember His wonders that He did, His signs, and the judgments of His mouth,

**¹³** O seed of Israel, His servant, O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones!

**¹⁴** He [is] Jehovah our God, In all the earth [are] His judgments.

**¹⁵** Remember ye to the age His covenant, The word He commanded — To a thousand generations,

**¹⁶** Which He hath made with Abraham, And His oath — to Isaac,

**¹⁷** And He establisheth it to Jacob for a statute, To Israel — a covenant age-during.

**¹⁸** Saying: To thee I give the land of Canaan, The portion of your inheritance,

**¹⁹** When ye are few of number, As a little thing, and sojourners in it.

**²⁰** And they go up and down, From nation unto nation, And from a kingdom unto another people.

**²¹** He hath not suffered any to oppress them, And reproveth on their account kings:

**²²** Come not against Mine anointed ones, And against My prophets do not evil.

**²³** Sing to Jehovah, all the earth, Proclaim from day unto day His salvation.

**²⁴** Rehearse among nations His glory, Among all the peoples His wonders.

**²⁵** For great [is] Jehovah, and praised greatly, And fearful He [is] above all gods.

**²⁶** For all gods of the peoples [are] nought, And Jehovah the heavens hath made.

**²⁷** Honour and majesty [are] before Him, Strength and joy [are] in His place.

**²⁸** Ascribe to Jehovah, ye families of peoples, Ascribe to Jehovah honour and strength.

**²⁹** Ascribe to Jehovah the honour of His name, Lift up a present, and come before Him. Bow yourselves to Jehovah, In the beauty of holiness.

**³⁰** Be pained before Him, all the earth:

**³¹** Also, established is the world, It is not moved! The heavens rejoice, and the earth is glad, And they say among nations: Jehovah hath reigned.

**³²** Roar doth the sea, and its fulness, Exult doth the field, and all that [is] in it,

**³³** Then sing do trees of the forest, From the presence of Jehovah, For He hath come to judge the earth!

**³⁴** Give thanks to Jehovah, for good, For to the age, [is] His kindness,

**³⁵** And say, Save us, O God of our salvation, And gather us, and deliver us from the nations, To give thanks to Thy holy name, To triumph in Thy praise.

**³⁶** Blessed [is] Jehovah, God of Israel, From the age and unto the age;' And all the people say, 'Amen,' and have given praise to Jehovah.

**³⁷** And he leaveth there before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, for Asaph and for his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, according to the matter of a day in its day,

**³⁸** both Obed-Edom and their brethren, sixty and eight, and Obed-Edom son of Jeduthun, and Hosah for gatekeepers,

**³⁹** and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of Jehovah, in a high place that [is] in Gibeon,

**⁴⁰** to cause to ascend burnt-offerings to Jehovah, on the altar of burnt-offering continually, morning and evening, and for all that is written in the law of Jehovah, that He charged on Israel.

**⁴¹** And with them [are] Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest of those chosen, who were defined by name, to give thanks to Jehovah, for to the age [is] His kindness,

**⁴²** and with them — Heman and Jeduthun — [are] trumpets and cymbals for those sounding, and instruments of the song of God, and the sons of Jeduthun [are] at the gate.

**⁴³** And all the people go, each to his house, and David turneth round to bless his house.
