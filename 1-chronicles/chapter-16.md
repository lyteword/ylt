# Chapter 16

<sup>1</sup> And they bring in the ark of God, and set it up in the midst of the tent that David hath stretched out for it, and they bring near burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God;

<sup>2</sup> and David ceaseth from offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, and blesseth the people in the name of Jehovah,

<sup>3</sup> and giveth a portion to every man of Israel, both man and woman: to each a cake of bread, and a measure of wine, and a grape-cake.

<sup>4</sup> And he putteth before the ark of Jehovah, of the Levites, ministers, even to make mention of, and to thank, and to give praise to Jehovah, God of Israel,

<sup>5</sup> Asaph the head, and his second Zechariah; Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, with instruments of psalteries, and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals is sounding;

<sup>6</sup> and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests [are] with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.

<sup>7</sup> On that day then hath David given at the beginning to give thanks to Jehovah by the hand of Asaph and his brethren: —

<sup>8</sup> Give thanks to Jehovah, call in His name, Make known among the peoples His doings.

<sup>9</sup> Sing ye to Him, sing psalms to Him, Meditate on all His wonders.

<sup>10</sup> Boast yourselves in His holy name, Rejoice doth the heart of those seeking Jehovah.

<sup>11</sup> Seek ye Jehovah and His strength, Seek His face continually.

<sup>12</sup> Remember His wonders that He did, His signs, and the judgments of His mouth,

<sup>13</sup> O seed of Israel, His servant, O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones!

<sup>14</sup> He [is] Jehovah our God, In all the earth [are] His judgments.

<sup>15</sup> Remember ye to the age His covenant, The word He commanded — To a thousand generations,

<sup>16</sup> Which He hath made with Abraham, And His oath — to Isaac,

<sup>17</sup> And He establisheth it to Jacob for a statute, To Israel — a covenant age-during.

<sup>18</sup> Saying: To thee I give the land of Canaan, The portion of your inheritance,

<sup>19</sup> When ye are few of number, As a little thing, and sojourners in it.

<sup>20</sup> And they go up and down, From nation unto nation, And from a kingdom unto another people.

<sup>21</sup> He hath not suffered any to oppress them, And reproveth on their account kings:

<sup>22</sup> Come not against Mine anointed ones, And against My prophets do not evil.

<sup>23</sup> Sing to Jehovah, all the earth, Proclaim from day unto day His salvation.

<sup>24</sup> Rehearse among nations His glory, Among all the peoples His wonders.

<sup>25</sup> For great [is] Jehovah, and praised greatly, And fearful He [is] above all gods.

<sup>26</sup> For all gods of the peoples [are] nought, And Jehovah the heavens hath made.

<sup>27</sup> Honour and majesty [are] before Him, Strength and joy [are] in His place.

<sup>28</sup> Ascribe to Jehovah, ye families of peoples, Ascribe to Jehovah honour and strength.

<sup>29</sup> Ascribe to Jehovah the honour of His name, Lift up a present, and come before Him. Bow yourselves to Jehovah, In the beauty of holiness.

<sup>30</sup> Be pained before Him, all the earth:

<sup>31</sup> Also, established is the world, It is not moved! The heavens rejoice, and the earth is glad, And they say among nations: Jehovah hath reigned.

<sup>32</sup> Roar doth the sea, and its fulness, Exult doth the field, and all that [is] in it,

<sup>33</sup> Then sing do trees of the forest, From the presence of Jehovah, For He hath come to judge the earth!

<sup>34</sup> Give thanks to Jehovah, for good, For to the age, [is] His kindness,

<sup>35</sup> And say, Save us, O God of our salvation, And gather us, and deliver us from the nations, To give thanks to Thy holy name, To triumph in Thy praise.

<sup>36</sup> Blessed [is] Jehovah, God of Israel, From the age and unto the age;' And all the people say, 'Amen,' and have given praise to Jehovah.

<sup>37</sup> And he leaveth there before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, for Asaph and for his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, according to the matter of a day in its day,

<sup>38</sup> both Obed-Edom and their brethren, sixty and eight, and Obed-Edom son of Jeduthun, and Hosah for gatekeepers,

<sup>39</sup> and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of Jehovah, in a high place that [is] in Gibeon,

<sup>40</sup> to cause to ascend burnt-offerings to Jehovah, on the altar of burnt-offering continually, morning and evening, and for all that is written in the law of Jehovah, that He charged on Israel.

<sup>41</sup> And with them [are] Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest of those chosen, who were defined by name, to give thanks to Jehovah, for to the age [is] His kindness,

<sup>42</sup> and with them — Heman and Jeduthun — [are] trumpets and cymbals for those sounding, and instruments of the song of God, and the sons of Jeduthun [are] at the gate.

<sup>43</sup> And all the people go, each to his house, and David turneth round to bless his house.
