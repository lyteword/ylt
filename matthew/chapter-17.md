# Chapter 17

<sup>1</sup> And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, and James, and John his brother, and doth bring them up to a high mount by themselves,

<sup>2</sup> and he was transfigured before them, and his face shone as the sun, and his garments did become white as the light,

<sup>3</sup> and lo, appear to them did Moses and Elijah, talking together with him.

<sup>4</sup> And Peter answering said to Jesus, 'Sir, it is good to us to be here; if thou wilt, we may make here three booths — for thee one, and for Moses one, and one for Elijah.'

<sup>5</sup> While he is yet speaking, lo, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and lo, a voice out of the cloud, saying, 'This is My Son, — the Beloved, in whom I did delight; hear him.'

<sup>6</sup> And the disciples having heard, did fall upon their face, and were exceedingly afraid,

<sup>7</sup> and Jesus having come near, touched them, and said, 'Rise, be not afraid,'

<sup>8</sup> and having lifted up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus only.

<sup>9</sup> And as they are coming down from the mount, Jesus charged them, saying, 'Say to no one the vision, till the Son of Man out of the dead may rise.'

<sup>10</sup> And his disciples questioned him, saying, 'Why then do the scribes say that Elijah it behoveth to come first?'

<sup>11</sup> And Jesus answering said to them, 'Elijah doth indeed come first, and shall restore all things,

<sup>12</sup> and I say to you — Elijah did already come, and they did not know him, but did with him whatever they would, so also the Son of Man is about to suffer by them.'

<sup>13</sup> Then understood the disciples that concerning John the Baptist he spake to them.

<sup>14</sup> And when they came unto the multitude, there came to him a man, kneeling down to him,

<sup>15</sup> and saying, 'Sir, deal kindly with my son, for he is lunatic, and doth suffer miserably, for often he doth fall into the fire, and often into the water,

<sup>16</sup> and I brought him near to thy disciples, and they were not able to heal him.'

<sup>17</sup> And Jesus answering said, 'O generation, unstedfast and perverse, till when shall I be with you? till when shall I bear you? bring him to me hither;'

<sup>18</sup> and Jesus rebuked him, and the demon went out of him, and the lad was healed from that hour.

<sup>19</sup> Then the disciples having come to Jesus by himself, said, 'Wherefore were we not able to cast him out?'

<sup>20</sup> And Jesus said to them, 'Through your want of faith; for verily I say to you, if ye may have faith as a grain of mustard, ye shall say to this mount, Remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove, and nothing shall be impossible to you,

<sup>21</sup> and this kind doth not go forth except in prayer and fasting.'

<sup>22</sup> And while they are living in Galilee, Jesus said to them, 'The Son of Man is about to be delivered up to the hands of men,

<sup>23</sup> and they shall kill him, and the third day he shall rise,' and they were exceeding sorry.

<sup>24</sup> And they having come to Capernaum, those receiving the didrachms came near to Peter, and said, 'Your teacher — doth he not pay the didrachms?' He saith, 'Yes.'

<sup>25</sup> And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, 'What thinkest thou, Simon? the kings of the earth — from whom do they receive custom or poll-tax? from their sons or from the strangers?'

<sup>26</sup> Peter saith to him, 'From the strangers.' Jesus said to him, 'Then are the sons free;

<sup>27</sup> but, that we may not cause them to stumble, having gone to the sea, cast a hook, and the fish that hath come up first take thou up, and having opened its mouth, thou shalt find a stater, that having taken, give to them for me and thee.'
