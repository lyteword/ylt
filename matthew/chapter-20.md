# Chapter 20

<sup>1</sup> 'For the reign of the heavens is like to a man, a householder, who went forth with the morning to hire workmen for his vineyard,

<sup>2</sup> and having agreed with the workmen for a denary a day, he sent them into his vineyard.

<sup>3</sup> 'And having gone forth about the third hour, he saw others standing in the market-place idle,

<sup>4</sup> and to these he said, Go ye — also ye — to the vineyard, and whatever may be righteous I will give you;

<sup>5</sup> and they went away. 'Again, having gone forth about the sixth and the ninth hour, he did in like manner.

<sup>6</sup> And about the eleventh hour, having gone forth, he found others standing idle, and saith to them, Why here have ye stood all the day idle?

<sup>7</sup> they say to him, Because no one did hire us; he saith to them, Go ye — ye also — to the vineyard, and whatever may be righteous ye shall receive.

<sup>8</sup> 'And evening having come, the lord of the vineyard saith to his steward, Call the workmen, and pay them the reward, having begun from the last — unto the first.

<sup>9</sup> And they of about the eleventh hour having come, did receive each a denary.

<sup>10</sup> 'And the first having come, did suppose that they shall receive more, and they received, they also, each a denary,

<sup>11</sup> and having received [it], they were murmuring against the householder, saying,

<sup>12</sup> that These, the last, wrought one hour, and thou didst make them equal to us, who were bearing the burden of the day — and the heat.

<sup>13</sup> 'And he answering said to one of them, Comrade, I do no unrighteousness to thee; for a denary didst not thou agree with me?

<sup>14</sup> take that which is thine, and go; and I will to give to this, the last, also as to thee;

<sup>15</sup> is it not lawful to me to do what I will in mine own? is thine eye evil because I am good?

<sup>16</sup> So the last shall be first, and the first last, for many are called, and few chosen.'

<sup>17</sup> And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples by themselves in the way, and said to them,

<sup>18</sup> 'Lo, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man shall be delivered to the chief priests and scribes,

<sup>19</sup> and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the nations to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify, and the third day he will rise again.'

<sup>20</sup> Then came near to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with her sons, bowing and asking something from him,

<sup>21</sup> and he said to her, 'What wilt thou?' She saith to him, 'Say, that they may sit — these my two sons — one on thy right hand, and one on the left, in thy reign.'

<sup>22</sup> And Jesus answering said, 'Ye have not known what ye ask for yourselves; are ye able to drink of the cup that I am about to drink? and with the baptism that I am baptized with, to be baptized?' They say to him, 'We are able.'

<sup>23</sup> And he saith to them, 'Of my cup indeed ye shall drink, and with the baptism that I am baptized with ye shall be baptized; but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give, but — to those for whom it hath been prepared by my father.'

<sup>24</sup> And the ten having heard, were much displeased with the two brothers,

<sup>25</sup> and Jesus having called them near, said, 'Ye have known that the rulers of the nations do exercise lordship over them, and those great do exercise authority over them,

<sup>26</sup> but not so shall it be among you, but whoever may will among you to become great, let him be your ministrant;

<sup>27</sup> and whoever may will among you to be first, let him be your servant;

<sup>28</sup> even as the Son of Man did not come to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.'

<sup>29</sup> And they going forth from Jericho, there followed him a great multitude,

<sup>30</sup> and lo, two blind men sitting by the way, having heard that Jesus doth pass by, cried, saying, 'Deal kindly with us, sir — Son of David.'

<sup>31</sup> And the multitude charged them that they might be silent, and they cried out the more, saying, 'Deal kindly with us sir — Son of David.'

<sup>32</sup> And having stood, Jesus called them, and said, 'What will ye [that] I may do to you?'

<sup>33</sup> they say to him, 'Sir, that our eyes may be opened;'

<sup>34</sup> and having been moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.
