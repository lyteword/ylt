# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> A roll of the birth of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham.

<sup>2</sup> Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren,

<sup>3</sup> and Judah begat Pharez and Zarah of Tamar, and Pharez begat Hezron, and Hezron begat Ram,

<sup>4</sup> and Ram begat Amminadab, and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,

<sup>5</sup> and Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab, and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth, and Obed begat Jesse,

<sup>6</sup> and Jesse begat David the king. And David the king begat Solomon, of her [who had been] Uriah's,

<sup>7</sup> and Solomon begat Rehoboam, and Rehoboam begat Abijah, and Abijah begat Asa,

<sup>8</sup> and Asa begat Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat begat Joram, and Joram begat Uzziah,

<sup>9</sup> and Uzziah begat Jotham, and Jotham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Hezekiah,

<sup>10</sup> and Hezekiah begat Manasseh, and Manasseh begat Amon, and Amon begat Josiah,

<sup>11</sup> and Josiah begat Jeconiah and his brethren, at the Babylonian removal.

<sup>12</sup> And after the Babylonian removal, Jeconiah begat Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel,

<sup>13</sup> and Zerubbabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azor,

<sup>14</sup> and Azor begat Sadok, and Sadok begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud,

<sup>15</sup> and Eliud begat Eleazar, and Eleazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob,

<sup>16</sup> and Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was begotten Jesus, who is named Christ.

<sup>17</sup> All the generations, therefore, from Abraham unto David [are] fourteen generations, and from David unto the Babylonian removal fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian removal unto the Christ, fourteen generations.

<sup>18</sup> And of Jesus Christ, the birth was thus: For his mother Mary having been betrothed to Joseph, before their coming together she was found to have conceived from the Holy Spirit,

<sup>19</sup> and Joseph her husband being righteous, and not willing to make her an example, did wish privately to send her away.

<sup>20</sup> And on his thinking of these things, lo, a messenger of the Lord in a dream appeared to him, saying, 'Joseph, son of David, thou mayest not fear to receive Mary thy wife, for that which in her was begotten [is] of the Holy Spirit,

<sup>21</sup> and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.'

<sup>22</sup> And all this hath come to pass, that it may be fulfilled that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,

<sup>23</sup> 'Lo, the virgin shall conceive, and she shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel,' which is, being interpreted 'With us [he is] God.'

<sup>24</sup> And Joseph, having risen from the sleep, did as the messenger of the Lord directed him, and received his wife,

<sup>25</sup> and did not know her till she brought forth her son — the first-born, and he called his name Jesus.
