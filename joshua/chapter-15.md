# Joshua 15 

**¹** And the lot for the tribe of the sons of Judah, for their families, is unto the border of Edom; the wilderness of Zin southward, at the extremity of the south;

**²** and to them the south border is at the extremity of the salt sea, from the bay which is looking southward;

**³** and it hath gone out unto the south to Maaleh-Akrabbim, and passed over to Zin, and gone up on the south to Kadesh-Barnea, and passed over [to] Hezron, and gone up to Adar, and turned round to Karkaa,

**⁴** and passed over [to] Azmon, and gone out [at] the brook of Egypt, and the outgoings of the border have been at the sea; this is to you the south border.

**⁵** And the east border [is] the salt sea, unto the extremity of the Jordan, and the border at the north quarter [is] from the bay of the sea, at the extremity of the Jordan;

**⁶** and the border hath gone up [to] Beth-Hoglah, and passed over on the north of Beth-Arabah, and the border hath gone up [to] the stone of Bohan son of Reuben:

**⁷** and the border hath gone up towards Debir from the valley of Achor, and northward looking unto Gilgal, which [is] over-against the ascent of Adummim, which [is] on the south of the brook, and the border hath passed over unto the waters of En-Shemesh, and its outgoings have been unto En-Rogel;

**⁸** and the border hath gone up the valley of the son of Hinnom, unto the side of the Jebusite on the south (it [is] Jerusalem), and the border hath gone up unto the top of the hill-country which [is] on the front of the valley of Hinnom westward, which [is] in the extremity of the valley of the Rephaim northward;

**⁹** and the border hath been marked out, from the top of the hill-country unto the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah, and hath gone out unto the cities of mount Ephron, and the border hath been marked out [to] Baalah, (it [is] Kirjath-Jearim);

**¹⁰** and the border hath gone round from Baalah westward, unto mount Seir, and passed over unto the side of mount Jearim (it [is] Chesalon), on the north, and gone down [to] Beth-Shemesh, and passed over to Timnah;

**¹¹** and the border hath gone out unto the side of Ekron northward, and the border hath been marked out [to] Shicron, and hath passed over to mount Baalah, and gone out [to] Jabneel; and the outgoings of the border have been at the sea.

**¹²** And the west border [is] to the great sea, and [its] border; this [is] the border of the sons of Judah round about for their families.

**¹³** And to Caleb son of Jephunneh hath he given a portion in the midst of the sons of Judah, according to the command of Jehovah to Joshua, [even] the city of Arba, father of Anak — it [is] Hebron.

**¹⁴** And Caleb is dispossessing thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, children of Anak,

**¹⁵** and he goeth up thence unto the inhabitants of Debir; and the name of Debir formerly is Kirjath-Sepher.

**¹⁶** And Caleb saith, 'He who smiteth Kirjath-Sephar, and hath captured it — I have given to him Achsah my daughter for a wife.'

**¹⁷** And Othniel son of Kenaz, brother of Caleb, doth capture it, and he giveth to him Achsah his daughter for a wife.

**¹⁸** And it cometh to pass, in her coming in, that she persuadeth him to ask from her father a field, and she lighteth from off the ass, and Caleb saith to her, 'What — to thee?'

**¹⁹** And she saith, 'Give to me a blessing; when the land of the south thou hast given me, then thou hast given to me springs of waters;' and he giveth to her the upper springs and the lower springs.

**²⁰** This [is] the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Judah, for their families.
