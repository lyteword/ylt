<sup>44</sup> and Jehovah giveth rest to them round about, according to all that which He hath sworn to their fathers, and there hath not stood a man in their presence of all their enemies, the whole of their enemies hath Jehovah given into their hand;

<sup>45</sup> there hath not fallen a thing of all the good thing which Jehovah spake unto the house of Israel — the whole hath come.
