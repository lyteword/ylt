# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> And it cometh to pass, when the wall hath been built, that I set up the doors, and the gatekeepers are appointed, and the singers, and the Levites,

<sup>2</sup> and I charge Hanani my brother, and Hananiah head of the palace, concerning Jerusalem — for he [is] as a man of truth, and fearing God above many —

<sup>3</sup> and I say to them, 'Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened till the heat of the sun, and while they are standing by let them shut the doors, and fasten, and appoint guards of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, each in his guard, and each over-against his house.'

<sup>4</sup> And the city [is] broad on both sides, and great, and the people [are] few in its midst, and there are no houses builded;

<sup>5</sup> and my God putteth it unto my heart, and I gather the freeman, and the prefects, and the people, for the genealogy, and I find a book of the genealogy of those coming up at the beginning, and I find written in it: —

<sup>6</sup> These [are] sons of the province, those coming up of the captives of the removal that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon removed — and they turn back to Jerusalem and to Judah, each to his city —
