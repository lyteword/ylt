# Chapter 5

**¹** For every chief priest — out of men taken — in behalf of men is set in things [pertaining] to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins,

**²** able to be gentle to those ignorant and going astray, since himself also is compassed with infirmity;

**³** and because of this infirmity he ought, as for the people, so also for himself to offer for sins;

**⁴** and no one to himself doth take the honour, but he who is called by God, as also Aaron:

**⁵** so also the Christ did not glorify himself to become chief priest, but He who spake unto him: 'My Son thou art, I to-day have begotten thee;'

**⁶** as also in another [place] He saith, 'Thou [art] a priest — to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;'

**⁷** who in the days of his flesh both prayers and supplications unto Him who was able to save him from death — with strong crying and tears — having offered up, and having been heard in respect to that which he feared,

**⁸** through being a Son, did learn by the things which he suffered — the obedience,

**⁹** and having been made perfect, he did become to all those obeying him a cause of salvation age-during,

**¹⁰** having been addressed by God a chief priest, according to the order of Melchisedek,

**¹¹** concerning whom we have much discourse and of hard explanation to say, since ye have become dull of hearing,

**¹²** for even owing to be teachers, because of the time, again ye have need that one teach you what [are] the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God, and ye have become having need of milk, and not of strong food,

**¹³** for every one who is partaking of milk [is] unskilled in the word of righteousness — for he is an infant,

**¹⁴** and of perfect men is the strong food, who because of the use are having the senses exercised, unto the discernment both of good and of evil.
