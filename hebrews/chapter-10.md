# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> For the law having a shadow of the coming good things — not the very image of the matters, every year, by the same sacrifices that they offer continually, is never able to make perfect those coming near,

<sup>2</sup> since, would they not have ceased to be offered, because of those serving having no more conscience of sins, having once been purified?

<sup>3</sup> but in those [sacrifices] is a remembrance of sins every year,

<sup>4</sup> for it is impossible for blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.

<sup>5</sup> Wherefore, coming into the world, he saith, 'Sacrifice and offering Thou didst not will, and a body Thou didst prepare for me,

<sup>6</sup> in burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offerings, Thou didst not delight,

<sup>7</sup> then I said, Lo, I come, (in a volume of the book it hath been written concerning me,) to do, O God, Thy will;'

<sup>8</sup> saying above — 'Sacrifice, and offering, and burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offering Thou didst not will, nor delight in,' — which according to the law are offered —

<sup>9</sup> then he said, 'Lo, I come to do, O God, Thy will;' he doth take away the first that the second he may establish;

<sup>10</sup> in the which will we are having been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once,

<sup>11</sup> and every priest, indeed, hath stood daily serving, and the same sacrifices many times offering, that are never able to take away sins.

<sup>12</sup> And He, for sin one sacrifice having offered — to the end, did sit down on the right hand of God, —

<sup>13</sup> as to the rest, expecting till He may place his enemies [as] his footstool,

<sup>14</sup> for by one offering he hath perfected to the end those sanctified;

<sup>15</sup> and testify to us also doth the Holy Spirit, for after that He hath said before,

<sup>16</sup> 'This [is] the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, giving My laws on their hearts, and upon their minds I will write them,'

<sup>17</sup> and 'their sins and their lawlessness I will remember no more;'

<sup>18</sup> and where forgiveness of these [is], there is no more offering for sin.

<sup>19</sup> Having, therefore, brethren, boldness for the entrance into the holy places, in the blood of Jesus,

<sup>20</sup> which way he did initiate for us — new and living, through the vail, that is, his flesh —

<sup>21</sup> and a high priest over the house of God,

<sup>22</sup> may we draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having the hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having the body bathed with pure water;

<sup>23</sup> may we hold fast the unwavering profession of the hope, (for faithful [is] He who did promise),

<sup>24</sup> and may we consider one another to provoke to love and to good works,

<sup>25</sup> not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as a custom of certain [is], but exhorting, and so much the more as ye see the day coming nigh.

<sup>26</sup> For we — wilfully sinning after the receiving the full knowledge of the truth — no more for sins doth there remain a sacrifice,

<sup>27</sup> but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery zeal, about to devour the opposers;

<sup>28</sup> any one who did set at nought a law of Moses, apart from mercies, by two or three witnesses, doth die,

<sup>29</sup> of how much sorer punishment shall he be counted worthy who the Son of God did trample on, and the blood of the covenant did count a common thing, in which he was sanctified, and to the Spirit of the grace did despite?

<sup>30</sup> for we have known Him who is saying, 'Vengeance [is] Mine, I will recompense, saith the Lord;' and again, 'The Lord shall judge His people;' —

<sup>31</sup> fearful [is] the falling into the hands of a living God.

<sup>32</sup> And call to your remembrance the former days, in which, having been enlightened, ye did endure much conflict of sufferings,

<sup>33</sup> partly both with reproaches and tribulations being made spectacles, and partly having become partners of those so living,

<sup>34</sup> for also with my bonds ye sympathised, and the robbery of your goods with joy ye did receive, knowing that ye have in yourselves a better substance in the heavens, and an enduring one.

<sup>35</sup> Ye may not cast away, then, your boldness, which hath great recompense of reward,

<sup>36</sup> for of patience ye have need, that the will of God having done, ye may receive the promise,

<sup>37</sup> for yet a very very little, He who is coming will come, and will not tarry;

<sup>38</sup> and 'the righteous by faith shall live,' and 'if he may draw back, My soul hath no pleasure in him,'

<sup>39</sup> and we are not of those drawing back to destruction, but of those believing to a preserving of soul.
