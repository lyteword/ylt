# Hebrews 4 

**¹** We may fear, then, lest a promise being left of entering into His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short,

**²** for we also are having good news proclaimed, even as they, but the word heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard,

**³** for we do enter into the rest — we who did believe, as He said, 'So I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest — ;' and yet the works were done from the foundation of the world,

**⁴** for He spake in a certain place concerning the seventh [day] thus: 'And God did rest in the seventh day from all His works;'

**⁵** and in this [place] again, 'If they shall enter into My rest — ;'

**⁶** since then, it remaineth for certain to enter into it, and those who did first hear good news entered not in because of unbelief —

**⁷** again He doth limit a certain day, 'To-day,' (in David saying, after so long a time,) as it hath been said, 'To-day, if His voice ye may hear, ye may not harden your hearts,'

**⁸** for if Joshua had given them rest, He would not concerning another day have spoken after these things;

**⁹** there doth remain, then, a sabbatic rest to the people of God,

**¹⁰** for he who did enter into his rest, he also rested from his works, as God from His own.

**¹¹** May we be diligent, then, to enter into that rest, that no one in the same example of the unbelief may fall,

**¹²** for the reckoning of God is living, and working, and sharp above every two-edged sword, and piercing unto the dividing asunder both of soul and spirit, of joints also and marrow, and a discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart;

**¹³** and there is not a created thing not manifest before Him, but all things [are] naked and open to His eyes — with whom is our reckoning.

**¹⁴** Having, then, a great chief priest passed through the heavens — Jesus the Son of God — may we hold fast the profession,

**¹⁵** for we have not a chief priest unable to sympathise with our infirmities, but [one] tempted in all things in like manner — apart from sin;

**¹⁶** we may come near, then, with freedom, to the throne of the grace, that we may receive kindness, and find grace — for seasonable help.
