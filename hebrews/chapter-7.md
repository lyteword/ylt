# Hebrews 7 

**¹** For this Melchisedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who did meet Abraham turning back from the smiting of the kings, and did bless him,

**²** to whom also a tenth of all did Abraham divide, (first, indeed, being interpreted, 'King of righteousness,' and then also, King of Salem, which is, King of Peace,)

**³** without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, and being made like to the Son of God, doth remain a priest continually.

**⁴** And see how great this one [is], to whom also a tenth Abraham the patriarch did give out of the best of the spoils,

**⁵** and those, indeed, out of the sons of Levi receiving the priesthood, a command have to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, their brethren, even though they came forth out of the loins of Abraham;

**⁶** and he who was not reckoned by genealogy of them, received tithes from Abraham, and him having the promises he hath blessed,

**⁷** and apart from all controversy, the less by the better is blessed —

**⁸** and here, indeed, men who die do receive tithes, and there [he], who is testified to that he was living,

**⁹** and so to speak, through Abraham even Levi who is receiving tithes, hath paid tithes,

**¹⁰** for he was yet in the loins of the father when Melchisedek met him.

**¹¹** If indeed, then, perfection were through the Levitical priesthood — for the people under it had received law — what further need, according to the order of Melchisedek, for another priest to arise, and not to be called according to the order of Aaron?

**¹²** for the priesthood being changed, of necessity also, of the law a change doth come,

**¹³** for he of whom these things are said in another tribe hath had part, of whom no one gave attendance at the altar,

**¹⁴** for [it is] evident that out of Judah hath arisen our Lord, in regard to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.

**¹⁵** And it is yet more abundantly most evident, if according to the similitude of Melchisedek there doth arise another priest,

**¹⁶** who came not according to the law of a fleshly command, but according to the power of an endless life,

**¹⁷** for He doth testify — 'Thou [art] a priest — to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;'

**¹⁸** for a disannulling indeed doth come of the command going before because of its weakness, and unprofitableness,

**¹⁹** (for nothing did the law perfect) and the bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw nigh to God.

**²⁰** And inasmuch as [it is] not apart from oath, (for those indeed apart from oath are become priests,

**²¹** and he with an oath through Him who is saying unto him, 'The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou [art] a priest — to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;')

**²²** by so much of a better covenant hath Jesus become surety,

**²³** and those indeed are many who have become priests, because by death they are hindered from remaining;

**²⁴** and he, because of his remaining — to the age, hath the priesthood not transient,

**²⁵** whence also he is able to save to the very end, those coming through him unto God — ever living to make intercession for them.

**²⁶** For such a chief priest did become us — kind, harmless, undefiled, separate from the sinners, and become higher than the heavens,

**²⁷** who hath no necessity daily, as the chief priests, first for his own sins to offer up sacrifice, then for those of the people; for this he did once, having offered up himself;

**²⁸** for the law doth appoint men chief priests, having infirmity, but the word of the oath that [is] after the law [appointeth] the Son — to the age having been perfected.
