# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> For this Melchisedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who did meet Abraham turning back from the smiting of the kings, and did bless him,

<sup>2</sup> to whom also a tenth of all did Abraham divide, (first, indeed, being interpreted, 'King of righteousness,' and then also, King of Salem, which is, King of Peace,)

<sup>3</sup> without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, and being made like to the Son of God, doth remain a priest continually.

<sup>4</sup> And see how great this one [is], to whom also a tenth Abraham the patriarch did give out of the best of the spoils,

<sup>5</sup> and those, indeed, out of the sons of Levi receiving the priesthood, a command have to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, their brethren, even though they came forth out of the loins of Abraham;

<sup>6</sup> and he who was not reckoned by genealogy of them, received tithes from Abraham, and him having the promises he hath blessed,

<sup>7</sup> and apart from all controversy, the less by the better is blessed —

<sup>8</sup> and here, indeed, men who die do receive tithes, and there [he], who is testified to that he was living,

<sup>9</sup> and so to speak, through Abraham even Levi who is receiving tithes, hath paid tithes,

<sup>10</sup> for he was yet in the loins of the father when Melchisedek met him.

<sup>11</sup> If indeed, then, perfection were through the Levitical priesthood — for the people under it had received law — what further need, according to the order of Melchisedek, for another priest to arise, and not to be called according to the order of Aaron?

<sup>12</sup> for the priesthood being changed, of necessity also, of the law a change doth come,

<sup>13</sup> for he of whom these things are said in another tribe hath had part, of whom no one gave attendance at the altar,

<sup>14</sup> for [it is] evident that out of Judah hath arisen our Lord, in regard to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.

<sup>15</sup> And it is yet more abundantly most evident, if according to the similitude of Melchisedek there doth arise another priest,

<sup>16</sup> who came not according to the law of a fleshly command, but according to the power of an endless life,

<sup>17</sup> for He doth testify — 'Thou [art] a priest — to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;'

<sup>18</sup> for a disannulling indeed doth come of the command going before because of its weakness, and unprofitableness,

<sup>19</sup> (for nothing did the law perfect) and the bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw nigh to God.

<sup>20</sup> And inasmuch as [it is] not apart from oath, (for those indeed apart from oath are become priests,

<sup>21</sup> and he with an oath through Him who is saying unto him, 'The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou [art] a priest — to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;')

<sup>22</sup> by so much of a better covenant hath Jesus become surety,

<sup>23</sup> and those indeed are many who have become priests, because by death they are hindered from remaining;

<sup>24</sup> and he, because of his remaining — to the age, hath the priesthood not transient,

<sup>25</sup> whence also he is able to save to the very end, those coming through him unto God — ever living to make intercession for them.

<sup>26</sup> For such a chief priest did become us — kind, harmless, undefiled, separate from the sinners, and become higher than the heavens,

<sup>27</sup> who hath no necessity daily, as the chief priests, first for his own sins to offer up sacrifice, then for those of the people; for this he did once, having offered up himself;

<sup>28</sup> for the law doth appoint men chief priests, having infirmity, but the word of the oath that [is] after the law [appointeth] the Son — to the age having been perfected.
