# Hebrews 1 

**¹** In many parts, and many ways, God of old having spoken to the fathers in the prophets,

**²** in these last days did speak to us in a Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He did make the ages;

**³** who being the brightness of the glory, and the impress of His subsistence, bearing up also the all things by the saying of his might — through himself having made a cleansing of our sins, sat down at the right hand of the greatness in the highest,

**⁴** having become so much better than the messengers, as he did inherit a more excellent name than they.

**⁵** For to which of the messengers said He ever, 'My Son thou art — I to-day have begotten thee?' and again, 'I will be to him for a father, and he shall be to Me for a son?'

**⁶** and when again He may bring in the first-born to the world, He saith, 'And let them bow before him — all messengers of God;'

**⁷** and unto the messengers, indeed, He saith, 'Who is making His messengers spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire;'

**⁸** and unto the Son: 'Thy throne, O God, [is] to the age of the age; a sceptre of righteousness [is] the sceptre of thy reign;

**⁹** thou didst love righteousness, and didst hate lawlessness; because of this did He anoint thee — God, thy God — with oil of gladness above thy partners;'

**¹⁰** and, 'Thou, at the beginning, Lord, the earth didst found, and a work of thy hands are the heavens;

**¹¹** these shall perish, and Thou dost remain, and all, as a garment, shall become old,

**¹²** and as a mantle Thou shall roll them together, and they shall be changed, and Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail.'

**¹³** And unto which of the messengers said He ever, 'Sit at My right hand, till I may make thine enemies thy footstool?'

**¹⁴** are they not all spirits of service — for ministration being sent forth because of those about to inherit salvation?
