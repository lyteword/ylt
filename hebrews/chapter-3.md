# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the apostle and chief priest of our profession, Christ Jesus,

<sup>2</sup> being stedfast to Him who did appoint him, as also Moses in all his house,

<sup>3</sup> for of more glory than Moses hath this one been counted worthy, inasmuch as more honour than the house hath he who doth build it,

<sup>4</sup> for every house is builded by some one, and He who the all things did build [is] God,

<sup>5</sup> and Moses indeed [was] stedfast in all his house, as an attendant, for a testimony of those things that were to be spoken,

<sup>6</sup> and Christ, as a Son over his house, whose house are we, if the boldness and the rejoicing of the hope unto the end we hold fast.

<sup>7</sup> Wherefore, (as the Holy Spirit saith, 'To-day, if His voice ye may hear —

<sup>8</sup> ye may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of the temptation in the wilderness,

<sup>9</sup> in which tempt Me did your fathers, they did prove Me, and saw My works forty years;

<sup>10</sup> wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, Always do they go astray in heart, and these have not known My ways;

<sup>11</sup> so I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest — !')

<sup>12</sup> See, brethren, lest there shall be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in the falling away from the living God,

<sup>13</sup> but exhort ye one another every day, while the To-day is called, that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of the sin,

<sup>14</sup> for partakers we have become of the Christ, if the beginning of the confidence unto the end we may hold fast,

<sup>15</sup> in its being said, 'To-day, if His voice ye may hear, ye may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation,'

<sup>16</sup> for certain having heard did provoke, but not all who did come out of Egypt through Moses;

<sup>17</sup> but with whom was He grieved forty years? was it not with those who did sin, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?

<sup>18</sup> and to whom did He swear that they shall not enter into His rest, except to those who did not believe? —

<sup>19</sup> and we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.
