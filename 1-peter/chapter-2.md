# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> Having put aside, then, all evil, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envyings, and all evil speakings,

<sup>2</sup> as new-born babes the word's pure milk desire ye, that in it ye may grow,

<sup>3</sup> if so be ye did taste that the Lord [is] gracious,

<sup>4</sup> to whom coming — a living stone — by men, indeed, having been disapproved of, but with God choice, precious,

<sup>5</sup> and ye yourselves, as living stones, are built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.

<sup>6</sup> Wherefore, also, it is contained in the Writing: 'Lo, I lay in Zion a chief corner-stone, choice, precious, and he who is believing on him may not be put to shame;'

<sup>7</sup> to you, then, who are believing [is] the preciousness; and to the unbelieving, a stone that the builders disapproved of, this one did become for the head of a corner,

<sup>8</sup> and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence — who are stumbling at the word, being unbelieving, — to which also they were set;

<sup>9</sup> and ye [are] a choice race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired, that the excellences ye may shew forth of Him who out of darkness did call you to His wondrous light;

<sup>10</sup> who [were] once not a people, and [are] now the people of God; who had not found kindness, and now have found kindness.

<sup>11</sup> Beloved, I call upon [you], as strangers and sojourners, to keep from the fleshly desires, that war against the soul,

<sup>12</sup> having your behaviour among the nations right, that in that which they speak against you as evil-doers, of the good works having beheld, they may glorify God in a day of inspection.

<sup>13</sup> Be subject, then, to every human creation, because of the Lord, whether to a king, as the highest,

<sup>14</sup> whether to governors, as to those sent through him, for punishment, indeed, of evil-doers, and a praise of those doing good;

<sup>15</sup> because, so is the will of God, doing good, to put to silence the ignorance of the foolish men;

<sup>16</sup> as free, and not having the freedom as the cloak of the evil, but as servants of God;

<sup>17</sup> to all give ye honour; the brotherhood love ye; God fear ye; the king honour ye.

<sup>18</sup> The domestics! be subjecting yourselves in all fear to the masters, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the cross;

<sup>19</sup> for this [is] gracious, if because of conscience toward God any one doth endure sorrows, suffering unrighteously;

<sup>20</sup> for what renown [is it], if sinning and being buffeted, ye do endure [it]? but if, doing good and suffering [for it], ye do endure, this [is] gracious with God,

<sup>21</sup> for to this ye were called, because Christ also did suffer for you, leaving to you an example, that ye may follow his steps,

<sup>22</sup> who did not commit sin, nor was guile found in his mouth,

<sup>23</sup> who being reviled — was not reviling again, suffering — was not threatening, and was committing himself to Him who is judging righteously,

<sup>24</sup> who our sins himself did bear in his body, upon the tree, that to the sins having died, to the righteousness we may live; by whose stripes ye were healed,

<sup>25</sup> for ye were as sheep going astray, but ye turned back now to the shepherd and overseer of your souls.
