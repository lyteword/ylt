# Hosea 14 

**¹** Turn back, O Israel, unto Jehovah thy God, For thou hast stumbled by thine iniquity.

**²** Take with you words, and turn to Jehovah, Say ye unto Him: 'Take away all iniquity, and give good, And we do render the fruit of our lips.

**³** Asshur doth not save us, on a horse we ride not, Nor do we say any more, Our God, to the work of our hands, For in Thee find mercy doth the fatherless.'

**⁴** I heal their backsliding, I love them freely, For turned back hath Mine anger from him.

**⁵** I am as dew to Israel, he flourisheth as a lily, And he striketh forth his roots as Lebanon.

**⁶** Go on do his sucklings, And his beauty is as an olive, And he hath fragrance as Lebanon.

**⁷** Return do the dwellers under his shadow, They revive [as] corn, and flourish as a vine, His memorial [is] as wine of Lebanon.

**⁸** O Ephraim, what to Me any more with idols? I — I afflicted, and I cause him to sing: 'I [am] as a green fir-tree,' From Me is thy fruit found.

**⁹** Who [is] wise, and doth understand these? Prudent, and knoweth them? For upright are the ways of Jehovah, And the righteous go on in them, And the transgressors stumble therein!
