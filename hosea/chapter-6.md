# Hosea 6 

**¹** 'Come, and we turn back unto Jehovah, For He hath torn, and He doth heal us, He doth smite, and He bindeth us up.

**²** He doth revive us after two days, In the third day He doth raise us up, And we live before Him.

**³** And we know — we pursue to know Jehovah, As the dawn prepared is His going forth, And He cometh in as a shower to us, As gathered rain — sprinkling earth.'

**⁴** What do I do to thee, O Ephraim? What do I do to thee, O Judah? Your goodness [is] as a cloud of the morning, And as dew rising early — going.

**⁵** Therefore I have hewed by prophets, I have slain them by sayings of My mouth, And My judgments to the light goeth forth.

**⁶** For kindness I desired, and not sacrifice, And a knowledge of God above burnt-offerings.

**⁷** And they, as Adam, transgressed a covenant, There they dealt treacherously against me.

**⁸** Gilead [is] a city of workers of iniquity, Slippery from blood.

**⁹** And as bands do wait for a man, A company of priests do murder — the way to Shechem, For wickedness they have done.

**¹⁰** In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing, There [is] the whoredom of Ephraim — defiled is Israel.

**¹¹** Also, O Judah, appointed is a harvest to thee, In My turning back [to] the captivity of My people!
