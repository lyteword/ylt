# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> 'When I give healing to Israel, Then revealed is the iniquity of Ephraim, And the wickedness of Samaria, For they have wrought falsehood, And a thief doth come in, Stript off hath a troop in the street,

<sup>2</sup> And they do not say to their heart, [That] all their evil I have remembered, Now compassed them have their doings, Over-against My face they have been.

<sup>3</sup> With their wickedness they make glad a king, And with their lies — princes.

<sup>4</sup> All of them [are] adulterers, Like a burning oven of a baker, He ceaseth from stirring up after kneading the dough, till its leavening.

<sup>5</sup> A day of our king! Princes have polluted themselves [with] the poison of wine, He hath drawn out his hand with scorners.

<sup>6</sup> For they have drawn near, As an oven [is] their heart, In their lying in wait all the night sleep doth their baker, Morning! he is burning as a flaming fire.

<sup>7</sup> All of them are warm as an oven, And they have devoured their judges, All their kings have fallen, There is none calling unto Me among them.

<sup>8</sup> Ephraim! among peoples he mixeth himself, Ephraim hath been a cake unturned.

<sup>9</sup> Devoured have strangers his power, And he hath not known, Also old age hath sprinkled [itself] on him, And he hath not known.

<sup>10</sup> And humbled hath been the excellency of Israel to his face, And they have not turned back unto Jehovah their God, Nor have they sought Him for all this.

<sup>11</sup> And Ephraim is as a simple dove without heart, Egypt they called on — [to] Asshur they have gone.

<sup>12</sup> When they go I spread over them My net, As the fowl of the heavens I bring them down, I chastise them as their company hath heard.

<sup>13</sup> Woe to them, for they wandered from Me, Destruction to them, for they transgressed against Me, And I — I ransom them, and they have spoken lies against Me,

<sup>14</sup> And have not cried unto Me with their heart, but howl on their beds, For corn and new wine they assemble themselves, They turn aside against Me.

<sup>15</sup> And I instructed — I strengthened their arms, And concerning Me they think evil!

<sup>16</sup> They turn back — not to the Most High, They have been as a deceitful bow, Fall by sword do their princes, From the insolence of their tongue, This [is] their derision in the land of Egypt!
