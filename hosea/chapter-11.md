# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> Because Israel [is] a youth, and I love him, Out of Egypt I have called for My Son.

<sup>2</sup> They have called to them rightly, They have gone from before them, To lords they do sacrifice, And to graven images they make perfume.

<sup>3</sup> And I have caused Ephraim to go on foot, Taking them by their arms, And they have not known that I strengthened them.

<sup>4</sup> With cords of man I do draw them, With thick cords of love, And I am to them as a raiser up of a yoke on their jaws, And I incline unto him — I feed [him].

<sup>5</sup> He turneth not back unto the land of Egypt, And Asshur — he [is] his king, For they have refused to return.

<sup>6</sup> Grievous hath been the sword in his cities, And it hath ended his bars, and consumed — from their own counsels.

<sup>7</sup> And My people are hanging in suspense, about My returning, And unto the Most High they do call, Together they exalt not.

<sup>8</sup> How do I give thee up, O Ephraim? Do I deliver thee up, O Israel? How do I make thee as Admah? Do I set thee as Zeboim? Turned in Me is My heart, kindled together have been My repentings.

<sup>9</sup> I do not the fierceness of My anger, I turn not back to destroy Ephraim, For God I [am], and not a man. In thy midst the Holy One, and I enter not in enmity,

<sup>10</sup> After Jehovah they go — as a lion He roareth, When He doth roar, then tremble do the sons from the west.

<sup>11</sup> They tremble as a sparrow out of Egypt, And as a dove out of the land of Asshur, And I have caused them to dwell in their own houses, An affirmation of Jehovah.

<sup>12</sup> Compassed Me with feigning hath Ephraim, And with deceit the house of Israel. And Judah again is ruling with God, And with the Holy Ones [is] faithful!
