# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Simeon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who did obtain a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ:

<sup>2</sup> Grace to you, and peace be multiplied in the acknowledgement of God and of Jesus our Lord!

<sup>3</sup> As all things to us His divine power (the things pertaining unto life and piety) hath given, through the acknowledgement of him who did call us through glory and worthiness,

<sup>4</sup> through which to us the most great and precious promises have been given, that through these ye may become partakers of a divine nature, having escaped from the corruption in the world in desires.

<sup>5</sup> And this same also — all diligence having brought in besides, superadd in your faith the worthiness, and in the worthiness the knowledge,

<sup>6</sup> and in the knowledge the temperance, and in the temperance the endurance, and in the endurance the piety,

<sup>7</sup> and in the piety the brotherly kindness, and in the brotherly kindness the love;

<sup>8</sup> for these things being to you and abounding, do make [you] neither inert nor unfruitful in regard to the acknowledging of our Lord Jesus Christ,

<sup>9</sup> for he with whom these things are not present is blind, dim-sighted, having become forgetful of the cleansing of his old sins;

<sup>10</sup> wherefore, the rather, brethren, be diligent to make stedfast your calling and choice, for these things doing, ye may never stumble,

<sup>11</sup> for so, richly shall be superadded to you the entrance into the age-during reign of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

<sup>12</sup> Wherefore, I will not be careless always to remind you concerning these things, though, having known them, and having been established in the present truth,

<sup>13</sup> and I think right, so long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up in reminding [you],

<sup>14</sup> having known that soon is the laying aside of my tabernacle, even as also our Lord Jesus Christ did shew to me,

<sup>15</sup> and I will be diligent that also at every time ye have, after my outgoing, power to make to yourselves the remembrance of these things.

<sup>16</sup> For, skilfully devised fables not having followed out, we did make known to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, but eye-witnesses having become of his majesty —

<sup>17</sup> for having received from God the Father honour and glory, such a voice being borne to him by the excellent glory: 'This is My Son — the beloved, in whom I was well pleased;'

<sup>18</sup> and this voice we — we did hear, out of heaven borne, being with him in the holy mount.

<sup>19</sup> And we have more firm the prophetic word, to which we do well giving heed, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, till day may dawn, and a morning star may arise — in your hearts;

<sup>20</sup> this first knowing, that no prophecy of the Writing doth come of private exposition,

<sup>21</sup> for not by will of man did ever prophecy come, but by the Holy Spirit borne on holy men of God spake.
