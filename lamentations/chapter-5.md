# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> Remember, O Jehovah, what hath befallen us, Look attentively, and see our reproach.

<sup>2</sup> Our inheritance hath been turned to strangers, Our houses to foreigners.

<sup>3</sup> Orphans we have been — without a father, our mothers [are] as widows.

<sup>4</sup> Our water for money we have drunk, Our wood for a price doth come.

<sup>5</sup> For our neck we have been pursued, We have laboured — there hath been no rest for us.

<sup>6</sup> [To] Egypt we have given a hand, [To] Asshur, to be satisfied with bread.

<sup>7</sup> Our fathers have sinned — they are not, We their iniquities have borne.

<sup>8</sup> Servants have ruled over us, A deliverer there is none from their hand.

<sup>9</sup> With our lives we bring in our bread, Because of the sword of the wilderness.

<sup>10</sup> Our skin as an oven hath been burning, Because of the raging of the famine.

<sup>11</sup> Wives in Zion they have humbled, Virgins — in cities of Judah.

<sup>12</sup> Princes by their hand have been hanged, The faces of elders have not been honoured.

<sup>13</sup> Young men to grind they have taken, And youths with wood have stumbled.

<sup>14</sup> The aged from the gate have ceased, Young men from their song.

<sup>15</sup> Ceased hath the joy of our heart, Turned to mourning hath been our dancing.

<sup>16</sup> Fallen hath the crown [from] our head, Woe [is] now to us, for we have sinned.

<sup>17</sup> For this hath our heart been sick, For these have our eyes been dim.

<sup>18</sup> For the mount of Zion — that is desolate, Foxes have gone up on it.

<sup>19</sup> Thou, O Jehovah, to the age remainest, Thy throne to generation and generation.

<sup>20</sup> Why for ever dost Thou forget us? Thou forsakest us for length of days!

<sup>21</sup> Turn us back, O Jehovah, unto Thee, And we turn back, renew our days as of old.

<sup>22</sup> For hast Thou utterly rejected us? Thou hast been wroth against us — exceedingly?
