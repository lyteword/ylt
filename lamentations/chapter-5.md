# Lamentations 5 

**¹** Remember, O Jehovah, what hath befallen us, Look attentively, and see our reproach.

**²** Our inheritance hath been turned to strangers, Our houses to foreigners.

**³** Orphans we have been — without a father, our mothers [are] as widows.

**⁴** Our water for money we have drunk, Our wood for a price doth come.

**⁵** For our neck we have been pursued, We have laboured — there hath been no rest for us.

**⁶** [To] Egypt we have given a hand, [To] Asshur, to be satisfied with bread.

**⁷** Our fathers have sinned — they are not, We their iniquities have borne.

**⁸** Servants have ruled over us, A deliverer there is none from their hand.

**⁹** With our lives we bring in our bread, Because of the sword of the wilderness.

**¹⁰** Our skin as an oven hath been burning, Because of the raging of the famine.

**¹¹** Wives in Zion they have humbled, Virgins — in cities of Judah.

**¹²** Princes by their hand have been hanged, The faces of elders have not been honoured.

**¹³** Young men to grind they have taken, And youths with wood have stumbled.

**¹⁴** The aged from the gate have ceased, Young men from their song.

**¹⁵** Ceased hath the joy of our heart, Turned to mourning hath been our dancing.

**¹⁶** Fallen hath the crown [from] our head, Woe [is] now to us, for we have sinned.

**¹⁷** For this hath our heart been sick, For these have our eyes been dim.

**¹⁸** For the mount of Zion — that is desolate, Foxes have gone up on it.

**¹⁹** Thou, O Jehovah, to the age remainest, Thy throne to generation and generation.

**²⁰** Why for ever dost Thou forget us? Thou forsakest us for length of days!

**²¹** Turn us back, O Jehovah, unto Thee, And we turn back, renew our days as of old.

**²²** For hast Thou utterly rejected us? Thou hast been wroth against us — exceedingly?
