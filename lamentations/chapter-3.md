# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> I [am] the man [who] hath seen affliction By the rod of His wrath.

<sup>2</sup> Me He hath led, and causeth to go [in] darkness, and without light.

<sup>3</sup> Surely against me He turneth back, He turneth His hand all the day.

<sup>4</sup> He hath worn out my flesh and my skin. He hath broken my bones.

<sup>5</sup> He hath built up against me, And setteth round poverty and weariness.

<sup>6</sup> In dark places He hath caused me to dwell, As the dead of old.

<sup>7</sup> He hath hedged me about, and I go not out, He hath made heavy my fetter.

<sup>8</sup> Also when I call and cry out, He hath shut out my prayer.

<sup>9</sup> He hath hedged my ways with hewn work, My paths He hath made crooked.

<sup>10</sup> A bear lying in wait He [is] to me, A lion in secret hiding-places.

<sup>11</sup> My ways He is turning aside, and He pulleth me in pieces, He hath made me a desolation.

<sup>12</sup> He hath trodden His bow, And setteth me up as a mark for an arrow.

<sup>13</sup> He hath caused to enter into my reins The sons of His quiver.

<sup>14</sup> I have been a derision to all my people, Their song all the day.

<sup>15</sup> He hath filled me with bitter things, He hath filled me [with] wormwood.

<sup>16</sup> And He breaketh with gravel my teeth, He hath covered me with ashes.

<sup>17</sup> And Thou castest off from peace my soul, I have forgotten prosperity.

<sup>18</sup> And I say, Perished hath my strength and my hope from Jehovah.

<sup>19</sup> Remember my affliction and my mourning, Wormwood and gall!

<sup>20</sup> Remember well, and bow down doth my soul in me.

<sup>21</sup> This I turn to my heart — therefore I hope.

<sup>22</sup> The kindnesses of Jehovah! For we have not been consumed, For not ended have His mercies.

<sup>23</sup> New every morning, abundant [is] thy faithfulness.

<sup>24</sup> My portion [is] Jehovah, hath my soul said, Therefore I hope for Him.

<sup>25</sup> Good [is] Jehovah to those waiting for Him, To the soul [that] seeketh Him.

<sup>26</sup> Good! when one doth stay and stand still For the salvation of Jehovah.

<sup>27</sup> Good for a man that he beareth a yoke in his youth.

<sup>28</sup> He sitteth alone, and is silent, For He hath laid [it] upon him.

<sup>29</sup> He putteth in the dust his mouth, if so be there is hope.

<sup>30</sup> He giveth to his smiter the cheek, He is filled with reproach.

<sup>31</sup> For the Lord doth not cast off to the age.

<sup>32</sup> For though He afflicted, yet He hath pitied, According to the abundance of His kindness.

<sup>33</sup> For He hath not afflicted with His heart, Nor doth He grieve the sons of men.

<sup>34</sup> To bruise under one's feet any bound ones of earth,

<sup>35</sup> To turn aside the judgment of a man, Over-against the face of the Most High,

<sup>36</sup> To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord hath not approved.

<sup>37</sup> Who [is] this — he hath said, and it is, [And] the Lord hath not commanded [it]?

<sup>38</sup> From the mouth of the Most High Go not forth the evils and the good.

<sup>39</sup> What — sigh habitually doth a living man, A man for his sin?

<sup>40</sup> We search our ways, and investigate, And turn back unto Jehovah.

<sup>41</sup> We lift up our heart on the hands unto God in the heavens.

<sup>42</sup> We — we have transgressed and rebelled, Thou — Thou hast not forgiven.

<sup>43</sup> Thou hast covered Thyself with anger, And dost pursue us; Thou hast slain — Thou hast not pitied.

<sup>44</sup> Thou hast covered Thyself with a cloud, So that prayer doth not pass through.

<sup>45</sup> Offscouring and refuse Thou dost make us In the midst of the peoples.

<sup>46</sup> Opened against us their mouth have all our enemies.

<sup>47</sup> Fear and a snare hath been for us, Desolation and destruction.

<sup>48</sup> Rivulets of water go down my eye, For the destruction of the daughter of my people.

<sup>49</sup> Mine eye is poured out, And doth not cease without intermission,

<sup>50</sup> Till Jehovah looketh and seeth from the heavens,

<sup>51</sup> My eye affecteth my soul, Because of all the daughters of my city.

<sup>52</sup> Hunted me sore as a bird have my enemies without cause.

<sup>53</sup> They have cut off in a pit my life, And they cast a stone against me.

<sup>54</sup> Flowed have waters over my head, I have said, I have been cut off.

<sup>55</sup> I called Thy name, O Jehovah, from the lower pit.

<sup>56</sup> My voice Thou hast heard, Hide not Thine ear at my breathing — at my cry.

<sup>57</sup> Thou hast drawn near in the day I call Thee, Thou hast said, Fear not.

<sup>58</sup> Thou hast pleaded, O Lord, the pleadings of my soul, Thou hast redeemed my life.

<sup>59</sup> Thou hast seen, O Jehovah, my overthrow, Judge Thou my cause.

<sup>60</sup> Thou hast seen all their vengeance, All their thoughts of me.

<sup>61</sup> Thou hast heard their reproach, O Jehovah, All their thoughts against me,

<sup>62</sup> The lips of my withstanders, Even their meditation against me all the day.

<sup>63</sup> Their sitting down, and their rising up, Behold attentively, I [am] their song.

<sup>64</sup> Thou returnest to them the deed, O Jehovah, According to the work of their hands.

<sup>65</sup> Thou givest to them a covered heart, Thy curse to them.

<sup>66</sup> Thou pursuest in anger, and destroyest them, From under the heavens of Jehovah!
