# Chapter 5

**¹** Whoredom is actually heard of among you, and such whoredom as is not even named among the nations — as that one hath the wife of the father! —

**²** and ye are having been puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he may be removed out of the midst of you who did this work,

**³** for I indeed, as being absent as to the body, and present as to the spirit, have already judged, as being present, him who so wrought this thing:

**⁴** in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ — ye being gathered together, also my spirit — with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,

**⁵** to deliver up such a one to the Adversary for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.

**⁶** Not good [is] your glorying; have ye not known that a little leaven the whole lump doth leaven?

**⁷** cleanse out, therefore, the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, according as ye are unleavened, for also our passover for us was sacrificed — Christ,

**⁸** so that we may keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of evil and wickedness, but with unleavened food of sincerity and truth.

**⁹** I did write to you in the epistle, not to keep company with whoremongers —

**¹⁰** and not certainly with the whoremongers of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or idolaters, seeing ye ought then to go forth out of the world —

**¹¹** and now, I did write to you not to keep company with [him], if any one, being named a brother, may be a whoremonger, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner — with such a one not even to eat together;

**¹²** for what have I also those without to judge? those within do ye not judge?

**¹³** and those without God doth judge; and put ye away the evil from among yourselves.
