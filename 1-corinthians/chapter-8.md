# 1 Corinthians 8 

**¹** And concerning the things sacrificed to idols, we have known that we all have knowledge: knowledge puffeth up, but love buildeth up;

**²** and if any one doth think to know anything, he hath not yet known anything according as it behoveth [him] to know;

**³** and if any one doth love God, this one hath been known by Him.

**⁴** Concerning the eating then of the things sacrificed to idols, we have known that an idol [is] nothing in the world, and that there is no other God except one;

**⁵** for even if there are those called gods, whether in heaven, whether upon earth — as there are gods many and lords many —

**⁶** yet to us [is] one God, the Father, of whom [are] the all things, and we to Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom [are] the all things, and we through Him;

**⁷** but not in all men [is] the knowledge, and certain with conscience of the idol, till now, as a thing sacrificed to an idol do eat [it], and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.

**⁸** But victuals do not commend us to God, for neither if we may eat are we in advance; nor if we may not eat, are we behind;

**⁹** but see, lest this privilege of yours may become a stumbling-block to the infirm,

**¹⁰** for if any one may see thee that hast knowledge in an idol's temple reclining at meat — shall not his conscience — he being infirm — be emboldened to eat the things sacrificed to idols,

**¹¹** and the brother who is infirm shall perish by thy knowledge, because of whom Christ died?

**¹²** and thus sinning in regard to the brethren, and smiting their weak conscience — in regard to Christ ye sin;

**¹³** wherefore, if victuals cause my brother to stumble, I may eat no flesh — to the age — that my brother I may not cause to stumble.
