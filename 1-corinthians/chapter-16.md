# Chapter 16

<sup>1</sup> And concerning the collection that [is] for the saints, as I directed to the assemblies of Galatia, so also ye — do ye;

<sup>2</sup> on every first [day] of the week, let each one of you lay by him, treasuring up whatever he may have prospered, that when I may come then collections may not be made;

<sup>3</sup> and whenever I may come, whomsoever ye may approve, through letters, these I will send to carry your favour to Jerusalem;

<sup>4</sup> and if it be meet for me also to go, with me they shall go.

<sup>5</sup> And I will come unto you, when I pass through Macedonia — for Macedonia I do pass through —

<sup>6</sup> and with you, it may be, I will abide, or even winter, that ye may send me forward whithersoever I go,

<sup>7</sup> for I do not wish to see you now in the passing, but I hope to remain a certain time with you, if the Lord may permit;

<sup>8</sup> and I will remain in Ephesus till the Pentecost,

<sup>9</sup> for a door to me hath been opened — great and effectual — and withstanders [are] many.

<sup>10</sup> And if Timotheus may come, see that he may become without fear with you, for the work of the Lord he doth work, even as I,

<sup>11</sup> no one, then, may despise him; and send ye him forward in peace, that he may come to me, for I expect him with the brethren;

<sup>12</sup> and concerning Apollos our brother, much I did entreat him that he may come unto you with the brethren, and it was not at all [his] will that he may come now, and he will come when he may find convenient.

<sup>13</sup> Watch ye, stand in the faith; be men, be strong;

<sup>14</sup> let all your things be done in love.

<sup>15</sup> And I entreat you, brethren, ye have known the household of Stephanas, that it is the first-fruit of Achaia, and to the ministration to the saints they did set themselves —

<sup>16</sup> that ye also be subject to such, and to every one who is working with [us] and labouring;

<sup>17</sup> and I rejoice over the presence of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus, because the lack of you did these fill up;

<sup>18</sup> for they did refresh my spirit and yours; acknowledge ye, therefore, those who [are] such.

<sup>19</sup> Salute you do the assemblies of Asia; salute you much in the Lord do Aquilas and Priscilla, with the assembly in their house;

<sup>20</sup> salute you do all the brethren; salute ye one another in an holy kiss.

<sup>21</sup> The salutation of [me] Paul with my hand;

<sup>22</sup> if any one doth not love the Lord Jesus Christ — let him be anathema! The Lord hath come!

<sup>23</sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ [is] with you;

<sup>24</sup> my love [is] with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
