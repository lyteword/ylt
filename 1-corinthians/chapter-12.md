# Chapter 12

<sup>1</sup> And concerning the spiritual things, brethren, I do not wish you to be ignorant;

<sup>2</sup> ye have known that ye were nations, unto the dumb idols — as ye were led — being carried away;

<sup>3</sup> wherefore, I give you to understand that no one, in the Spirit of God speaking, saith Jesus [is] anathema, and no one is able to say Jesus [is] Lord, except in the Holy Spirit.

<sup>4</sup> And there are diversities of gifts, and the same Spirit;

<sup>5</sup> and there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord;

<sup>6</sup> and there are diversities of workings, and it is the same God — who is working the all in all.

<sup>7</sup> And to each hath been given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit;

<sup>8</sup> for to one through the Spirit hath been given a word of wisdom, and to another a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;

<sup>9</sup> and to another faith in the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healings in the same Spirit;

<sup>10</sup> and to another in-workings of mighty deeds; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits; and to another [divers] kinds of tongues; and to another interpretation of tongues:

<sup>11</sup> and all these doth work the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each severally as he intendeth.

<sup>12</sup> For, even as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the one body, being many, are one body, so also [is] the Christ,

<sup>13</sup> for also in one Spirit we all to one body were baptized, whether Jews or Greeks, whether servants or freemen, and all into one Spirit were made to drink,

<sup>14</sup> for also the body is not one member, but many;

<sup>15</sup> if the foot may say, 'Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body;' it is not, because of this, not of the body;

<sup>16</sup> and if the ear may say, 'Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body;' it is not, because of this, not of the body?

<sup>17</sup> If the whole body [were] an eye, where the hearing? if the whole hearing, where the smelling?

<sup>18</sup> and now, God did set the members each one of them in the body, according as He willed,

<sup>19</sup> and if all were one member, where the body?

<sup>20</sup> and now, indeed, [are] many members, and one body;

<sup>21</sup> and an eye is not able to say to the hand, 'I have no need of thee;' nor again the head to the feet, 'I have no need of you.'

<sup>22</sup> But much more the members of the body which seem to be more infirm are necessary,

<sup>23</sup> and those that we think to be less honourable of the body, around these we put more abundant honour, and our unseemly things have seemliness more abundant,

<sup>24</sup> and our seemly things have no need; but God did temper the body together, to the lacking part having given more abundant honour,

<sup>25</sup> that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same anxiety for one another,

<sup>26</sup> and whether one member doth suffer, suffer with [it] do all the members, or one member is glorified, rejoice with [it] do all the members;

<sup>27</sup> and ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.

<sup>28</sup> And some, indeed, did God set in the assembly, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, afterwards powers, afterwards gifts of healings, helpings, governings, divers kinds of tongues;

<sup>29</sup> [are] all apostles? [are] all prophets? [are] all teachers? [are] all powers?

<sup>30</sup> have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?

<sup>31</sup> and desire earnestly the better gifts; and yet a far excelling way do I shew to you:
