# 1 Corinthians 11 

**¹** Followers of me become ye, as I also [am] of Christ.

**²** And I praise you, brethren, that in all things ye remember me, and according as I did deliver to you, the deliverances ye keep,

**³** and I wish you to know that of every man the head is the Christ, and the head of a woman is the husband, and the head of Christ is God.

**⁴** Every man praying or prophesying, having the head covered, doth dishonour his head,

**⁵** and every woman praying or prophesying with the head uncovered, doth dishonour her own head, for it is one and the same thing with her being shaven,

**⁶** for if a woman is not covered — then let her be shorn, and if [it is] a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven — let her be covered;

**⁷** for a man, indeed, ought not to cover the head, being the image and glory of God, and a woman is the glory of a man,

**⁸** for a man is not of a woman, but a woman [is] of a man,

**⁹** for a man also was not created because of the woman, but a woman because of the man;

**¹⁰** because of this the woman ought to have [a token of] authority upon the head, because of the messengers;

**¹¹** but neither [is] a man apart from a woman, nor a woman apart from a man, in the Lord,

**¹²** for as the woman [is] of the man, so also the man [is] through the woman, and the all things [are] of God.

**¹³** In your own selves judge ye; is it seemly for a woman uncovered to pray to God?

**¹⁴** doth not even nature itself teach you, that if a man indeed have long hair, a dishonour it is to him?

**¹⁵** and a woman, if she have long hair, a glory it is to her, because the hair instead of a covering hath been given to her;

**¹⁶** and if any one doth think to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the assemblies of God.

**¹⁷** And this declaring, I give no praise, because not for the better, but for the worse ye come together;

**¹⁸** for first, indeed, ye coming together in an assembly, I hear of divisions being among you, and partly I believe [it],

**¹⁹** for it behoveth sects also to be among you, that those approved may become manifest among you;

**²⁰** ye, then, coming together at the same place — it is not to eat the Lord's supper;

**²¹** for each his own supper doth take before in the eating, and one is hungry, and another is drunk;

**²²** why, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or the assembly of God do ye despise, and shame those not having? what may I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I do not praise!

**²³** For I — I received from the Lord that which also I did deliver to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread,

**²⁴** and having given thanks, he brake, and said, 'Take ye, eat ye, this is my body, that for you is being broken; this do ye — to the remembrance of me.'

**²⁵** In like manner also the cup after the supping, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood; this do ye, as often as ye may drink [it] — to the remembrance of me;'

**²⁶** for as often as ye may eat this bread, and this cup may drink, the death of the Lord ye do shew forth — till he may come;

**²⁷** so that whoever may eat this bread or may drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, guilty he shall be of the body and blood of the Lord:

**²⁸** and let a man be proving himself, and so of the bread let him eat, and of the cup let him drink;

**²⁹** for he who is eating and drinking unworthily, judgment to himself he doth eat and drink — not discerning the body of the Lord.

**³⁰** Because of this, among you many [are] weak and sickly, and sleep do many;

**³¹** for if ourselves we were discerning, we would not be being judged,

**³²** and being judged by the Lord, we are chastened, that with the world we may not be condemned;

**³³** so then, my brethren, coming together to eat, for one another wait ye;

**³⁴** and if any one is hungry, at home let him eat, that to judgment ye may not come together; and the rest, whenever I may come, I shall arrange.
