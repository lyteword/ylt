# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> Followers of me become ye, as I also [am] of Christ.

<sup>2</sup> And I praise you, brethren, that in all things ye remember me, and according as I did deliver to you, the deliverances ye keep,

<sup>3</sup> and I wish you to know that of every man the head is the Christ, and the head of a woman is the husband, and the head of Christ is God.

<sup>4</sup> Every man praying or prophesying, having the head covered, doth dishonour his head,

<sup>5</sup> and every woman praying or prophesying with the head uncovered, doth dishonour her own head, for it is one and the same thing with her being shaven,

<sup>6</sup> for if a woman is not covered — then let her be shorn, and if [it is] a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven — let her be covered;

<sup>7</sup> for a man, indeed, ought not to cover the head, being the image and glory of God, and a woman is the glory of a man,

<sup>8</sup> for a man is not of a woman, but a woman [is] of a man,

<sup>9</sup> for a man also was not created because of the woman, but a woman because of the man;

<sup>10</sup> because of this the woman ought to have [a token of] authority upon the head, because of the messengers;

<sup>11</sup> but neither [is] a man apart from a woman, nor a woman apart from a man, in the Lord,

<sup>12</sup> for as the woman [is] of the man, so also the man [is] through the woman, and the all things [are] of God.

<sup>13</sup> In your own selves judge ye; is it seemly for a woman uncovered to pray to God?

<sup>14</sup> doth not even nature itself teach you, that if a man indeed have long hair, a dishonour it is to him?

<sup>15</sup> and a woman, if she have long hair, a glory it is to her, because the hair instead of a covering hath been given to her;

<sup>16</sup> and if any one doth think to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the assemblies of God.

<sup>17</sup> And this declaring, I give no praise, because not for the better, but for the worse ye come together;

<sup>18</sup> for first, indeed, ye coming together in an assembly, I hear of divisions being among you, and partly I believe [it],

<sup>19</sup> for it behoveth sects also to be among you, that those approved may become manifest among you;

<sup>20</sup> ye, then, coming together at the same place — it is not to eat the Lord's supper;

<sup>21</sup> for each his own supper doth take before in the eating, and one is hungry, and another is drunk;

<sup>22</sup> why, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or the assembly of God do ye despise, and shame those not having? what may I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I do not praise!

<sup>23</sup> For I — I received from the Lord that which also I did deliver to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread,

<sup>24</sup> and having given thanks, he brake, and said, 'Take ye, eat ye, this is my body, that for you is being broken; this do ye — to the remembrance of me.'

<sup>25</sup> In like manner also the cup after the supping, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood; this do ye, as often as ye may drink [it] — to the remembrance of me;'

<sup>26</sup> for as often as ye may eat this bread, and this cup may drink, the death of the Lord ye do shew forth — till he may come;

<sup>27</sup> so that whoever may eat this bread or may drink the cup of the Lord unworthily, guilty he shall be of the body and blood of the Lord:

<sup>28</sup> and let a man be proving himself, and so of the bread let him eat, and of the cup let him drink;

<sup>29</sup> for he who is eating and drinking unworthily, judgment to himself he doth eat and drink — not discerning the body of the Lord.

<sup>30</sup> Because of this, among you many [are] weak and sickly, and sleep do many;

<sup>31</sup> for if ourselves we were discerning, we would not be being judged,

<sup>32</sup> and being judged by the Lord, we are chastened, that with the world we may not be condemned;

<sup>33</sup> so then, my brethren, coming together to eat, for one another wait ye;

<sup>34</sup> and if any one is hungry, at home let him eat, that to judgment ye may not come together; and the rest, whenever I may come, I shall arrange.
