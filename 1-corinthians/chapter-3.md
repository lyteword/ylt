# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> And I, brethren, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly — as to babes in Christ;

<sup>2</sup> with milk I fed you, and not with meat, for ye were not yet able, but not even yet are ye now able,

<sup>3</sup> for yet ye are fleshly, for where [there is] among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not fleshly, and in the manner of men do walk?

<sup>4</sup> for when one may say, 'I, indeed, am of Paul;' and another, 'I — of Apollos;' are ye not fleshly?

<sup>5</sup> Who, then, is Paul, and who Apollos, but ministrants through whom ye did believe, and to each as the Lord gave?

<sup>6</sup> I planted, Apollos watered, but God was giving growth;

<sup>7</sup> so that neither is he who is planting anything, nor he who is watering, but He who is giving growth — God;

<sup>8</sup> and he who is planting and he who is watering are one, and each his own reward shall receive, according to his own labour,

<sup>9</sup> for of God we are fellow-workmen; God's tillage, God's building ye are.

<sup>10</sup> According to the grace of God that was given to me, as a wise master-builder, a foundation I have laid, and another doth build on [it],

<sup>11</sup> for other foundation no one is able to lay except that which is laid, which is Jesus the Christ;

<sup>12</sup> and if any one doth build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw —

<sup>13</sup> of each the work shall become manifest, for the day shall declare [it], because in fire it is revealed, and the work of each, what kind it is, the fire shall prove;

<sup>14</sup> if of any one the work doth remain that he built on [it], a wage he shall receive;

<sup>15</sup> if of any the work is burned up, he shall suffer loss; and himself shall be saved, but so as through fire.

<sup>16</sup> have ye not known that ye are a sanctuary of God, and the Spirit of God doth dwell in you?

<sup>17</sup> if any one the sanctuary of God doth waste, him shall God waste; for the sanctuary of God is holy, the which ye are.

<sup>18</sup> Let no one deceive himself; if any one doth seem to be wise among you in this age — let him become a fool, that he may become wise,

<sup>19</sup> for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, for it hath been written, 'Who is taking the wise in their craftiness;'

<sup>20</sup> and again, 'The Lord doth know the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.'

<sup>21</sup> So then, let no one glory in men, for all things are yours,

<sup>22</sup> whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things about to be — all are yours,

<sup>23</sup> and ye [are] Christ's, and Christ [is] God's.
