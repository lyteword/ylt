# Chapter 33

**¹** And this [is] the blessing [with] which Moses the man of God blessed the sons of Israel before his death,

**²** and he saith: — 'Jehovah from Sinai hath come, And hath risen from Seir for them; He hath shone from mount Paran, And hath come [with] myriads of holy ones; At His right hand [are] springs for them.

**³** Also He [is] loving the peoples; All His holy ones [are] in thy hand, And they — they sat down at thy foot, [Each] He lifteth up at thy words.

**⁴** A law hath Moses commanded us, A possession of the assembly of Jacob.

**⁵** And he is in Jeshurun king, In the heads of the people gathering together, The tribes of Israel!

**⁶** Let Reuben live, and not die, And let his men be a number.

**⁷** And this [is] for Judah; and he saith: — Hear, O Jehovah, the voice of Judah, And unto his people do Thou bring him in; His hand hath striven for him, And an help from his adversaries art Thou.

**⁸** And of Levi he said: — Thy Thummim and thy Urim [are] for thy pious one, Whom Thou hast tried in Massah, Thou dost strive with Him at the waters of Meribah;

**⁹** Who is saying of his father and his mother, I have not seen him; And his brethren he hath not discerned, And his sons he hath not known; For they have observed Thy saying, And Thy covenant they keep.

**¹⁰** They teach Thy judgments to Jacob, And Thy law to Israel; They put perfume in Thy nose, And whole burnt-offering on Thine altar.

**¹¹** Bless, O Jehovah, his strength, And the work of his hands Thou acceptest, Smite the loins of his withstanders, And of those hating him — that they rise not!

**¹²** Of Benjamin he said: — The beloved of Jehovah doth tabernacle confidently by him, Covering him over all the day; Yea, between his shoulders He doth tabernacle.

**¹³** And of Joseph he said: — Blessed of Jehovah [is] his land, By precious things of the heavens, By dew, and by the deep crouching beneath,

**¹⁴** And by precious things — fruits of the sun, And by precious things — cast forth by the moons,

**¹⁵** And by chief things — of the ancient mountains, And by precious things — of the age-during heights,

**¹⁶** And by precious things — of earth and its fulness, And the good pleasure Of Him who is dwelling in the bush, — Let it come for the head of Joseph, And for the crown of him Who is separate from his brethren.

**¹⁷** His honour [is] a firstling of his ox, And his horns [are] horns of a reem; By them peoples he doth push together To the ends of earth; And they [are] the myriads of Ephraim, And they [are] the thousands of Manasseh.

**¹⁸** And of Zebulun he said: — Rejoice, O Zebulun, in thy going out, And, O Issachar, in thy tents;

**¹⁹** Peoples [to] the mountain they call, There they sacrifice righteous sacrifices; For the abundance of the seas they suck, And hidden things hidden in the sand.

**²⁰** And of Gad he said: — Blessed of the Enlarger [is] Gad, As a lioness he doth tabernacle, And hath torn the arm — also the crown!

**²¹** And he provideth the first part for himself, For there the portion of the lawgiver is covered, And he cometh [with] the heads of the people; The righteousness of Jehovah he hath done, And His judgments with Israel.

**²²** And of Dan he said: — Dan [is] a lion's whelp; he doth leap from Bashan.

**²³** And of Naphtali he said: — O Naphtali, satisfied with pleasure, And full of the blessing of Jehovah, West and south possess thou.

**²⁴** And of Asher he said: — Blessed with sons [is] Asher, Let him be accepted by his brethren, And dipping in oil his foot.

**²⁵** Iron and brass [are] thy shoes, And as thy days — thy strength.

**²⁶** There is none like the God of Jeshurun, Riding the heavens in thy help, And in His excellency the skies.

**²⁷** A habitation [is] the eternal God, And beneath [are] arms age-during. And He casteth out from thy presence the enemy, and saith, 'Destroy!'

**²⁸** And Israel doth tabernacle [in] confidence alone; The eye of Jacob [is] unto a land of corn and wine; Also His heavens drop down dew.

**²⁹** O thy happiness, O Israel! who is like thee? A people saved by Jehovah, The shield of thy help, And He who [is] the sword of thine excellency: And thine enemies are subdued for thee, And thou on their high places dost tread.'
