# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> The Visions of Isaiah son of Amoz, that he hath seen concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

<sup>2</sup> Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, For Jehovah hath spoken: Sons I have nourished and brought up, And they — they transgressed against Me.

<sup>3</sup> An ox hath known its owner, And an ass the crib of its master, Israel hath not known, My people hath not understood.

<sup>4</sup> Ah, sinning nation, a people heavy [with] iniquity, A seed of evil doers, sons — corrupters! They have forsaken Jehovah, They have despised the Holy One of Israel, They have gone away backward.

<sup>5</sup> Wherefore are ye stricken any more? Ye do add apostasy! Every head is become diseased, and every heart [is] sick.

<sup>6</sup> From the sole of the foot — unto the head, There is no soundness in it, Wound, and bruise, and fresh smiting! They have not been closed nor bound, Nor have they softened with ointment.

<sup>7</sup> Your land [is] a desolation, your cities burnt with fire, Your ground, before you strangers are consuming it, And a desolation as overthrown by strangers!

<sup>8</sup> And left hath been the daughter of Zion, As a booth in a vineyard, As a lodge in a place of cucumbers — as a city besieged.

<sup>9</sup> Unless Jehovah of Hosts had left to us a remnant, Shortly — as Sodom we had been, To Gomorrah we had been like!

<sup>10</sup> Hear the word of Jehovah, ye rulers of Sodom, Give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah,

<sup>11</sup> 'Why to Me the abundance of your sacrifices? saith Jehovah, I have been satiated [with] burnt-offerings of rams, And fat of fatlings; And blood of bullocks, and lambs, And he-goats I have not desired.

<sup>12</sup> When ye come in to appear before Me, Who hath required this of your hand, To trample My courts?

<sup>13</sup> Add not to bring in a vain present, Incense — an abomination it [is] to Me, New moon, and sabbath, calling of convocation! Rendure not iniquity — and a restraint!

<sup>14</sup> Your new moons and your set seasons hath My soul hated, They have been upon me for a burden, I have been weary of bearing.

<sup>15</sup> And in your spreading forth your hands, I hide mine eyes from you, Also when ye increase prayer, I do not hear, Your hands of blood have been full.

<sup>16</sup> Wash ye, make ye pure, Turn aside the evil of your doings, from before Mine eyes, Cease to do evil, learn to do good.

<sup>17</sup> Seek judgment, make happy the oppressed, Judge the fatherless, strive [for] the widow.

<sup>18</sup> Come, I pray you, and we reason, saith Jehovah, If your sins are as scarlet, as snow they shall be white, If they are red as crimson, as wool they shall be!

<sup>19</sup> If ye are willing, and have hearkened, The good of the land ye consume,

<sup>20</sup> And if ye refuse, and have rebelled, [By] the sword ye are consumed, For the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken.

<sup>21</sup> How hath a faithful city become a harlot? I have filled it [with] judgment, Righteousness lodgeth in it — now murderers.

<sup>22</sup> Thy silver hath become dross, Thy drink polluted with water.

<sup>23</sup> Thy princes [are] apostates, and companions of thieves, Every one loving a bribe, and pursuing rewards, The fatherless they judge not, And the plea of the widow cometh not to them.

<sup>24</sup> Therefore — the affirmation of the Lord — Jehovah of Hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: Ah, I am eased of Mine adversaries, And I am avenged of Mine enemies,

<sup>25</sup> And I turn back My hand upon thee, And I refine as purity thy dross, And I turn aside all thy tin,

<sup>26</sup> And I give back thy judges as at the first, And thy counsellors as in the beginning, After this thou art called, 'A city of righteousness — a faithful city.'

<sup>27</sup> Zion in judgment is redeemed, And her captivity in righteousness.

<sup>28</sup> And the destruction of transgressors and sinners [is] together, And those forsaking Jehovah are consumed.

<sup>29</sup> For [men] are ashamed because of the oaks That ye have desired, And ye are confounded because of the gardens That ye have chosen.

<sup>30</sup> For ye are as an oak whose leaf is fading, And as a garden that hath no water.

<sup>31</sup> And the strong hath been for tow, And his work for a spark, And burned have both of them together, And there is none quenching!
