# Chapter 33

**¹** Woe, spoiler! and thou not spoiled, And treacherous! and they dealt not treacherously with thee, When thou dost finish, O spoiler, thou art spoiled, When thou dost finish dealing treacherously, They deal treacherously with thee.

**²** O Jehovah, favour us, for thee we have waited, Be their arm, in the mornings, Yea, our salvation in time of adversity.

**³** From the voice of a multitude fled have peoples, From thine exaltation scattered have been nations.

**⁴** And gathered hath been your spoil, A gathering of the caterpillar, As a running to and fro of locusts is he running on it.

**⁵** Set on high is Jehovah, for He is dwelling on high, He filled Zion [with] judgment and righteousness,

**⁶** And hath been the stedfastness of thy times, The strength of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge, Fear of Jehovah — it [is] His treasure.

**⁷** Lo, 'Their Ariel,' they have cried without, Messengers of peace do weep bitterly.

**⁸** Desolated have been highways, Ceased hath he who passeth along the path, He hath broken covenant, He hath despised enemies, He hath not esteemed a man.

**⁹** Mourned, languished hath the land, Confounded hath been Lebanon, Withered hath been Sharon as a wilderness, And shaking are Bashan and Carmel.

**¹⁰** Now, do I arise, saith Jehovah, Now I am exalted, now I am lifted up.

**¹¹** Ye conceive chaff, ye bear stubble, Your spirit! — fire devoureth you.

**¹²** And peoples have been [as] burnings of lime, Thorns, as sweepings, with fire they burn.

**¹³** Hear, ye far off, that which I have done, And know, ye near ones, My might.

**¹⁴** Afraid in Zion have been sinners, Seized hath trembling the profane: Who doth dwell for us — consuming fire, Who doth dwell for us — burnings of the age?

**¹⁵** Whoso is walking righteously, And is speaking uprightly, Kicking against gain of oppressions, Shaking his hands from taking hold on a bribe, Stopping his ear from hearing of blood, And shutting his eyes from looking on evil,

**¹⁶** He high places doth inhabit, Strongholds of rock [are] his high tower, His bread hath been given, his waters stedfast.

**¹⁷** A king in his beauty, see do thine eyes, They see a land afar off.

**¹⁸** Thy heart doth meditate terror, Where [is] he who is counting? Where [is] he who is weighing? Where [is] he who is counting the towers?

**¹⁹** The strong people thou seest not, A people deeper of lip than to be understood, Of a scorned tongue, there is no understanding.

**²⁰** See Zion, the city of our meetings, Thine eyes see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, A tent not taken down, Not removed are its pins for ever, And none of its cords are broken.

**²¹** But there mighty [is] Jehovah for us, A place of rivers — streams broad of sides, No ship with oars doth go into it, And a mighty ship doth not pass over it.

**²²** For Jehovah our judge, Jehovah our lawgiver, Jehovah our king — He doth save us.

**²³** Left have been thy ropes, They strengthen not rightly their mast, They have not spread out a sail, Then apportioned hath been a prey of much spoil, The lame have taken spoil.

**²⁴** Nor doth an inhabitant say, 'I was sick,' The people that is dwelling in it, is forgiven of iniquity!
