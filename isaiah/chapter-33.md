# Chapter 33

<sup>1</sup> Woe, spoiler! and thou not spoiled, And treacherous! and they dealt not treacherously with thee, When thou dost finish, O spoiler, thou art spoiled, When thou dost finish dealing treacherously, They deal treacherously with thee.

<sup>2</sup> O Jehovah, favour us, for thee we have waited, Be their arm, in the mornings, Yea, our salvation in time of adversity.

<sup>3</sup> From the voice of a multitude fled have peoples, From thine exaltation scattered have been nations.

<sup>4</sup> And gathered hath been your spoil, A gathering of the caterpillar, As a running to and fro of locusts is he running on it.

<sup>5</sup> Set on high is Jehovah, for He is dwelling on high, He filled Zion [with] judgment and righteousness,

<sup>6</sup> And hath been the stedfastness of thy times, The strength of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge, Fear of Jehovah — it [is] His treasure.

<sup>7</sup> Lo, 'Their Ariel,' they have cried without, Messengers of peace do weep bitterly.

<sup>8</sup> Desolated have been highways, Ceased hath he who passeth along the path, He hath broken covenant, He hath despised enemies, He hath not esteemed a man.

<sup>9</sup> Mourned, languished hath the land, Confounded hath been Lebanon, Withered hath been Sharon as a wilderness, And shaking are Bashan and Carmel.

<sup>10</sup> Now, do I arise, saith Jehovah, Now I am exalted, now I am lifted up.

<sup>11</sup> Ye conceive chaff, ye bear stubble, Your spirit! — fire devoureth you.

<sup>12</sup> And peoples have been [as] burnings of lime, Thorns, as sweepings, with fire they burn.

<sup>13</sup> Hear, ye far off, that which I have done, And know, ye near ones, My might.

<sup>14</sup> Afraid in Zion have been sinners, Seized hath trembling the profane: Who doth dwell for us — consuming fire, Who doth dwell for us — burnings of the age?

<sup>15</sup> Whoso is walking righteously, And is speaking uprightly, Kicking against gain of oppressions, Shaking his hands from taking hold on a bribe, Stopping his ear from hearing of blood, And shutting his eyes from looking on evil,

<sup>16</sup> He high places doth inhabit, Strongholds of rock [are] his high tower, His bread hath been given, his waters stedfast.

<sup>17</sup> A king in his beauty, see do thine eyes, They see a land afar off.

<sup>18</sup> Thy heart doth meditate terror, Where [is] he who is counting? Where [is] he who is weighing? Where [is] he who is counting the towers?

<sup>19</sup> The strong people thou seest not, A people deeper of lip than to be understood, Of a scorned tongue, there is no understanding.

<sup>20</sup> See Zion, the city of our meetings, Thine eyes see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, A tent not taken down, Not removed are its pins for ever, And none of its cords are broken.

<sup>21</sup> But there mighty [is] Jehovah for us, A place of rivers — streams broad of sides, No ship with oars doth go into it, And a mighty ship doth not pass over it.

<sup>22</sup> For Jehovah our judge, Jehovah our lawgiver, Jehovah our king — He doth save us.

<sup>23</sup> Left have been thy ropes, They strengthen not rightly their mast, They have not spread out a sail, Then apportioned hath been a prey of much spoil, The lame have taken spoil.

<sup>24</sup> Nor doth an inhabitant say, 'I was sick,' The people that is dwelling in it, is forgiven of iniquity!
