# Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> And passing by, he saw a man blind from birth,

<sup>2</sup> and his disciples asked him, saying, 'Rabbi, who did sin, this one or his parents, that he should be born blind?'

<sup>3</sup> Jesus answered, 'Neither did this one sin nor his parents, but that the works of God may be manifested in him;

<sup>4</sup> it behoveth me to be working the works of Him who sent me while it is day; night doth come, when no one is able to work: —

<sup>5</sup> when I am in the world, I am a light of the world.'

<sup>6</sup> These things saying, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and rubbed the clay on the eyes of the blind man, and said to him,

<sup>7</sup> 'Go away, wash at the pool of Siloam,' which is, interpreted, Sent. He went away, therefore, and did wash, and came seeing;

<sup>8</sup> the neighbours, therefore, and those seeing him before, that he was blind, said, 'Is not this he who is sitting and begging?'

<sup>9</sup> others said — 'This is he;' and others — 'He is like to him;' he himself said, — 'I am [he].'

<sup>10</sup> They said, therefore, to him, 'How were thine eyes opened?'

<sup>11</sup> he answered and said, 'A man called Jesus made clay, and rubbed my eyes, and said to me, Go away to the pool of Siloam, and wash; and having gone away and having washed, I received sight;'

<sup>12</sup> they said, therefore, to him, 'Where is that one?' he saith, 'I have not known.'

<sup>13</sup> They bring him to the Pharisees who once [was] blind,

<sup>14</sup> and it was a sabbath when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.

<sup>15</sup> Again, therefore, the Pharisees also were asking him how he received sight, and he said to them, 'Clay he did put upon my eyes, and I did wash — and I see.'

<sup>16</sup> Of the Pharisees, therefore, certain said, 'This man is not from God, because the sabbath he doth not keep;' others said, 'How is a man — a sinful one — able to do such signs?' and there was a division among them.

<sup>17</sup> They said to the blind man again, 'Thou — what dost thou say of him — that he opened thine eyes?'

<sup>18</sup> and he said — 'He is a prophet.' The Jews, therefore, did not believe concerning him that he was blind and did receive sight, till that they called the parents of him who received sight,

<sup>19</sup> and they asked them, saying, 'Is your son, of whom ye say that he was born blind? how then now doth he see?'

<sup>20</sup> His parents answered them and said, 'We have known that this is our son, and that he was born blind;

<sup>21</sup> and how he now seeth, we have not known; or who opened his eyes, we have not known; himself is of age, ask him; he himself shall speak concerning himself.'

<sup>22</sup> These things said his parents, because they were afraid of the Jews, for already had the Jews agreed together, that if any one may confess him — Christ, he may be put out of the synagogue;

<sup>23</sup> because of this his parents said — 'He is of age, ask him.'

<sup>24</sup> They called, therefore, a second time the man who was blind, and they said to him, 'Give glory to God, we have known that this man is a sinner;'

<sup>25</sup> he answered, therefore, and said, 'If he be a sinner — I have not known, one thing I have known, that, being blind, now I see.'

<sup>26</sup> And they said to him again, 'What did he to thee? how did he open thine eyes?'

<sup>27</sup> He answered them, 'I told you already, and ye did not hear; why again do ye wish to hear? do ye also wish to become his disciples?'

<sup>28</sup> They reviled him, therefore, and said, 'Thou art his disciple, and we are Moses' disciples;

<sup>29</sup> we have known that God hath spoken to Moses, but this one — we have not known whence he is.'

<sup>30</sup> The man answered and said to them, 'Why, in this is a wonderful thing, that ye have not known whence he is, and he opened my eyes!

<sup>31</sup> and we have known that God doth not hear sinners, but, if any one may be a worshipper of God, and may do His will, him He doth hear;

<sup>32</sup> from the age it was not heard, that any one did open eyes of one who hath been born blind;

<sup>33</sup> if this one were not from God, he were not able to do anything.'

<sup>34</sup> They answered and said to him, 'In sins thou wast born altogether, and thou dost teach us!' and they cast him forth without.

<sup>35</sup> Jesus heard that they cast him forth without, and having found him, he said to him, 'Dost thou believe in the Son of God?'

<sup>36</sup> he answered and said, 'Who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?'

<sup>37</sup> And Jesus said to him, 'Thou hast both seen him, and he who is speaking with thee is he;'

<sup>38</sup> and he said, 'I believe, sir,' and bowed before him.

<sup>39</sup> And Jesus said, 'For judgment I to this world did come, that those not seeing may see, and those seeing may become blind.'

<sup>40</sup> And those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and they said to him, 'Are we also blind?'

<sup>41</sup> Jesus said to them, 'If ye were blind, ye were not having had sin, but now ye say — We see, therefore doth your sin remain.
