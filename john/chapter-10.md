# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> 'Verily, verily, I say to you, He who is not entering through the door to the fold of the sheep, but is going up from another side, that one is a thief and a robber;

<sup>2</sup> and he who is entering through the door is shepherd of the sheep;

<sup>3</sup> to this one the doorkeeper doth open, and the sheep hear his voice, and his own sheep he doth call by name, and doth lead them forth;

<sup>4</sup> and when his own sheep he may put forth, before them he goeth on, and the sheep follow him, because they have known his voice;

<sup>5</sup> and a stranger they will not follow, but will flee from him, because they have not known the voice of strangers.'

<sup>6</sup> This similitude spake Jesus to them, and they knew not what the things were that he was speaking to them;

<sup>7</sup> Jesus said therefore again to them, 'Verily, verily, I say to you — I am the door of the sheep;

<sup>8</sup> all, as many as came before me, are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them;

<sup>9</sup> I am the door, through me if any one may come in, he shall be saved, and he shall come in, and go out, and find pasture.

<sup>10</sup> 'The thief doth not come, except that he may steal, and kill, and destroy; I came that they may have life, and may have [it] abundantly.

<sup>11</sup> 'I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd his life layeth down for the sheep;

<sup>12</sup> and the hireling, and not being a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, doth behold the wolf coming, and doth leave the sheep, and doth flee; and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep;

<sup>13</sup> and the hireling doth flee because he is an hireling, and is not caring for the sheep.

<sup>14</sup> 'I am the good shepherd, and I know my [sheep], and am known by mine,

<sup>15</sup> according as the Father doth know me, and I know the Father, and my life I lay down for the sheep,

<sup>16</sup> and other sheep I have that are not of this fold, these also it behoveth me to bring, and my voice they will hear, and there shall become one flock — one shepherd.

<sup>17</sup> 'Because of this doth the Father love me, because I lay down my life, that again I may take it;

<sup>18</sup> no one doth take it from me, but I lay it down of myself; authority I have to lay it down, and authority I have again to take it; this command I received from my Father.'

<sup>19</sup> Therefore, again, there came a division among the Jews, because of these words,

<sup>20</sup> and many of them said, 'He hath a demon, and is mad, why do ye hear him?'

<sup>21</sup> others said, 'These sayings are not those of a demoniac; is a demon able blind men's eyes to open?'

<sup>22</sup> And the dedication in Jerusalem came, and it was winter,

<sup>23</sup> and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the porch of Solomon,

<sup>24</sup> the Jews, therefore, came round about him, and said to him, 'Till when our soul dost thou hold in suspense? if thou art the Christ, tell us freely.'

<sup>25</sup> Jesus answered them, 'I told you, and ye do not believe; the works that I do in the name of my Father, these testify concerning me;

<sup>26</sup> but ye do not believe, for ye are not of my sheep,

<sup>27</sup> according as I said to you: My sheep my voice do hear, and I know them, and they follow me,

<sup>28</sup> and life age-during I give to them, and they shall not perish — to the age, and no one shall pluck them out of my hand;

<sup>29</sup> my Father, who hath given to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to pluck out of the hand of my Father;

<sup>30</sup> I and the Father are one.'

<sup>31</sup> Therefore, again, did the Jews take up stones that they may stone him;

<sup>32</sup> Jesus answered them, 'Many good works did I shew you from my Father; because of which work of them do ye stone me?'

<sup>33</sup> The Jews answered him, saying, 'For a good work we do not stone thee, but for evil speaking, and because thou, being a man, dost make thyself God.'

<sup>34</sup> Jesus answered them, 'Is it not having been written in your law: I said, ye are gods?

<sup>35</sup> if them he did call gods unto whom the word of God came, (and the Writing is not able to be broken,)

<sup>36</sup> of him whom the Father did sanctify, and send to the world, do ye say — Thou speakest evil, because I said, Son of God I am?

<sup>37</sup> if I do not the works of my Father, do not believe me;

<sup>38</sup> and if I do, even if me ye may not believe, the works believe, that ye may know and may believe that in me [is] the Father, and I in Him.'

<sup>39</sup> Therefore were they seeking again to seize him, and he went forth out of their hand,

<sup>40</sup> and went away again to the other side of the Jordan, to the place where John was at first baptizing, and remained there,

<sup>41</sup> and many came unto him, and said — 'John, indeed, did no sign, and all things, as many as John said about this one were true;'

<sup>42</sup> and many did believe in him there.
