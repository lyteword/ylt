# Exodus 27 

**¹** 'And thou hast made the altar of shittim wood, five cubits the length, and five cubits the breadth — the altar is square — and three cubits its height.

**²** And thou hast made its horns on its four corners, its horns are of the same, and thou hast overlaid it [with] brass.

**³** And thou hast made its pots to remove its ashes, and its shovels, and its bowls, and its forks, and its fire-pans, even all its vessels thou dost make of brass.

**⁴** 'And thou hast made for it a grate of net-work of brass, and hast made on the net four rings of brass on its four extremities,

**⁵** and hast put it under the compass of the altar beneath, and the net hath been unto the middle of the altar.

**⁶** 'And thou hast made staves for the altar, staves of shittim wood, and hast overlaid them [with] brass.

**⁷** And the staves have been brought into the rings, and the staves have been on the two sides of the altar in bearing it.

**⁸** Hollow with boards thou dost make it, as it hath been shewed thee in the mount, so do they make [it].

**⁹** 'And thou hast made the court of the tabernacle: for the south side southward, hangings for the court of twined linen, a hundred by the cubit [is] the length for the one side,

**¹⁰** and its twenty pillars and their twenty sockets [are] of brass, the pegs of the pillars and their fillets [are] of silver;

**¹¹** and so for the north side in length, hangings of a hundred [cubits] in length, and its twenty pillars and their twenty sockets [are] of brass, the pegs of the pillars and their fillets [are] of silver.

**¹²** 'And [for] the breadth of the court at the west side [are] hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten.

**¹³** And [for] the breadth of the court at the east side, eastward, [are] fifty cubits.

**¹⁴** And the hangings at the side [are] fifteen cubits, their pillars three, and their sockets three.

**¹⁵** And at the second side [are] hangings fifteen [cubits], their pillars three, and their sockets three.

**¹⁶** 'And for the gate of the court a covering of twenty cubits, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen, work of an embroiderer; their pillars four, their sockets four.

**¹⁷** All the pillars of the court round about [are] filleted [with] silver, their pegs [are] silver, and their sockets brass.

**¹⁸** 'The length of the court [is] a hundred by the cubit, and the breadth fifty by fifty, and the height five cubits, of twined linen, and their sockets [are] brass,

**¹⁹** even all the vessels of the tabernacle, in all its service, and all its pins, and all the pins of the court, [are] brass.

**²⁰** 'And thou — thou dost command the sons of Israel, and they bring unto thee pure beaten olive oil for the light, to cause the lamp to go up continually;

**²¹** in the tent of meeting, at the outside of the vail, which [is] over the testimony, doth Aaron — his sons also — arrange it from evening till morning before Jehovah — a statute age-during to their generations, from the sons of Israel.
