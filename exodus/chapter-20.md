# Exodus 20 

**¹** 'And God speaketh all these words, saying,

**²** I [am] Jehovah thy God, who hath brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of a house of servants.

**³** 'Thou hast no other Gods before Me.

**⁴** 'Thou dost not make to thyself a graven image, or any likeness which [is] in the heavens above, or which [is] in the earth beneath, or which [is] in the waters under the earth.

**⁵** Thou dost not bow thyself to them, nor serve them: for I, Jehovah thy God, [am] a zealous God, charging iniquity of fathers on sons, on the third [generation], and on the fourth, of those hating Me,

**⁶** and doing kindness to thousands, of those loving Me and keeping My commands.

**⁷** 'Thou dost not take up the name of Jehovah thy God for a vain thing, for Jehovah acquitteth not him who taketh up His name for a vain thing.

**⁸** 'Remember the Sabbath-day to sanctify it;

**⁹** six days thou dost labour, and hast done all thy work,

**¹⁰** and the seventh day [is] a Sabbath to Jehovah thy God; thou dost not do any work, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, thy man-servant, and thy handmaid, and thy cattle, and thy sojourner who is within thy gates, —

**¹¹** for six days hath Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that [is] in them, and resteth in the seventh day; therefore hath Jehovah blessed the Sabbath-day, and doth sanctify it.

**¹²** 'Honour thy father and thy mother, so that thy days are prolonged on the ground which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee.

**¹³** 'Thou dost not murder.

**¹⁴** 'Thou dost not commit adultery.

**¹⁵** 'Thou dost not steal.

**¹⁶** 'Thou dost not answer against thy neighbour a false testimony.

**¹⁷** 'Thou dost not desire the house of thy neighbour, thou dost not desire the wife of thy neighbour, or his man-servant, or his handmaid, or his ox, or his ass, or anything which [is] thy neighbour's.'

**¹⁸** And all the people are seeing the voices, and the flames, and the sound of the trumpet, and the mount smoking; and the people see, and move, and stand afar off,

**¹⁹** and say unto Moses, 'Speak thou with us, and we hear, and let not God speak with us, lest we die.'

**²⁰** And Moses saith unto the people, 'Fear not, for to try you hath God come, and in order that His fear may be before your faces — that ye sin not.'

**²¹** And the people stand afar off, and Moses hath drawn nigh unto the thick darkness where God [is].

**²²** And Jehovah saith unto Moses, 'Thus dost thou say unto the sons of Israel: Ye — ye have seen that from the heavens I have spoken with you;

**²³** ye do not make with Me gods of silver, even gods of gold ye do not make to yourselves.

**²⁴** 'An altar of earth thou dost make for Me, and thou hast sacrificed on it thy burnt-offerings and thy peace-offerings, thy flock and thy herd; in every place where I cause My name to be remembered I come in unto thee, and have blessed thee.

**²⁵** 'And if an altar of stones thou dost make to Me, thou dost not build them of hewn work; when thy tool thou hast waved over it, then thou dost pollute it;

**²⁶** neither dost thou go up by steps on Mine altar, that thy nakedness be not revealed upon it.
