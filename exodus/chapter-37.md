# Chapter 37

<sup>1</sup> And Bezaleel maketh the ark of shittim wood, two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height;

<sup>2</sup> and he overlayeth it with pure gold within and without, and maketh for it a wreath of gold round about;

<sup>3</sup> and he casteth for it four rings of gold, on its four feet, even two rings on its one side, and two rings on its second side;

<sup>4</sup> and he maketh staves of shittim wood, and overlayeth them with gold,

<sup>5</sup> and he bringeth in the staves into the rings, by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.

<sup>6</sup> And he maketh a mercy-seat of pure gold, two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth;

<sup>7</sup> and he maketh two cherubs of gold, of beaten work he hath made them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat;

<sup>8</sup> one cherub at the end on this [side], and one cherub at the end on that, out of the mercy-seat he hath made the cherubs, at its two ends;

<sup>9</sup> and the cherubs are spreading out wings on high, covering over the mercy-seat with their wings, and their faces [are] one towards another; towards the mercy-seat have the faces of the cherubs been.

<sup>10</sup> And he maketh the table of shittim wood; two cubits its length, and a cubit its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height,

<sup>11</sup> and overlayeth it with pure gold, and maketh for it a wreath of gold round about.

<sup>12</sup> And he maketh for it a border of a handbreadth round about, and maketh a wreath of gold for its border round about;

<sup>13</sup> and he casteth for it four rings of gold, and putteth the rings on the four corners which [are] to its four feet;

<sup>14</sup> over-against the border have the rings been, places for staves to bear the table.

<sup>15</sup> And he maketh the staves of shittim wood, and overlayeth them with gold, to bear the table;

<sup>16</sup> and he maketh the vessels which [are] upon the table, its dishes, and its bowls, and its cups, and the cups by which they pour out, of pure gold.

<sup>17</sup> And he maketh the candlestick of pure gold; of beaten work he hath made the candlestick, its base, and its branch, its calyxes, its knops, and its flowers, have been of the same;

<sup>18</sup> and six branches are coming out of its sides, three branches of the candlestick out of its one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of its second side;

<sup>19</sup> three calyxes, made like almonds, in the one branch, a knop and a flower; and three calyxes, made like almonds, in another branch, a knop and a flower; so to the six branches which are coming out of the candlestick.

<sup>20</sup> And in the candlestick [are] four calyxes, made like almonds, its knops, and its flowers,

<sup>21</sup> and a knop under the two branches of the same, and a knop under the two branches of the same, and a knop under the two branches of the same, [are] to the six branches which are coming out of it;

<sup>22</sup> their knops and their branches have been of the same; all of it one beaten work of pure gold.

<sup>23</sup> And he maketh its seven lamps, and its snuffers, and its snuff-dishes, of pure gold;

<sup>24</sup> of a talent of pure gold he hath made it, and all its vessels.

<sup>25</sup> And he maketh the perfume-altar of shittim wood; a cubit its length, and a cubit its breadth (square), and two cubits its height; its horns have been of the same;

<sup>26</sup> and he overlayeth it with pure gold, its top and its sides round about, and its horns; and he maketh for it a wreath of gold round about;

<sup>27</sup> and two rings of gold he hath made for it under its wreath, at its two corners, at its two sides, for places for staves to bear it with them.

<sup>28</sup> And he maketh the staves of shittim wood, and overlayeth them with gold;

<sup>29</sup> and he maketh the holy anointing oil, and the pure spice-perfume — work of a compounder.
