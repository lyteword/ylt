# Chapter 25

**¹** And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,

**²** 'Speak unto the sons of Israel, and they take for Me a heave-offering; from every man whose heart impelleth him ye do take My heave-offering.

**³** 'And this [is] the heave-offering which ye take from them; gold, and silver, and brass,

**⁴** and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and linen, and goats' [hair],

**⁵** and rams' skins made red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,

**⁶** oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil, and for the perfume of the spices,

**⁷** shoham stones, and stones for setting for an ephod, and for a breastplate.

**⁸** 'And they have made for Me a sanctuary, and I have tabernacled in their midst;

**⁹** according to all that which I am shewing thee, the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all its vessels, even so ye do make [it].

**¹⁰** 'And they have made an ark of shittim wood; two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height;

**¹¹** and thou hast overlaid it [with] pure gold, within and without thou dost overlay it, and thou hast made on it a ring of gold round about.

**¹²** 'And thou hast cast for it four rings of gold, and hast put [them] on its four feet, even two rings on its one side, and two rings on its second side;

**¹³** and thou hast made staves of shittim wood, and hast overlaid them [with] gold,

**¹⁴** and hast brought the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, to bear the ark by them,

**¹⁵** in the rings of the ark are the staves, they are not turned aside from it;

**¹⁶** and thou hast put unto the ark the testimony which I give unto thee.

**¹⁷** 'And thou hast made a mercy-seat of pure gold, two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth;

**¹⁸** and thou hast made two cherubs of gold, beaten work dost thou make them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat;

**¹⁹** and make thou one cherub at the end on this side, and one cherub at the end on that; at the mercy-seat ye do make the cherubs on its two ends.

**²⁰** 'And the cherubs have been spreading out wings on high, covering the mercy-seat over with their wings, and their faces [are] one towards another — towards the mercy-seat are the faces of the cherubs.

**²¹** 'And thou hast put the mercy-seat on the ark above, and unto the ark thou dost put the testimony which I give unto thee;

**²²** and I have met with thee there, and have spoken with thee from off the mercy-seat (from between the two cherubs, which [are] on the ark of the testimony) all that which I command thee concerning the sons of Israel.

**²³** 'And thou hast made a table of shittim wood, two cubits its length, and a cubit its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height,

**²⁴** and hast overlaid it [with] pure gold, and hast made for it a crown of gold round about,

**²⁵** and hast made for it a border of a handbreadth round about, and hast made a crown of gold to its border round about.

**²⁶** 'And thou hast made to it four rings of gold, and hast put the rings on the four corners, which [are] to its four feet;

**²⁷** over-against the border are the rings for places for staves to bear the table;

**²⁸** and thou hast made the staves of shittim wood, and hast overlaid them with gold, and the table hath been borne with them;

**²⁹** and thou hast made its dishes, and its bowls, and its covers, and its cups, with which they pour out; of pure gold thou dost make them;

**³⁰** and thou hast put on the table bread of the presence before Me continually.

**³¹** 'And thou hast made a candlestick of pure gold, of beaten work is the candlestick made; its base, and its branch, its calyxes, its knops, and its flowers are of the same;

**³²** and six branches are coming out of its sides, three branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the second side;

**³³** three calyxes made like almonds in the one branch, a knop and a flower, and three calyxes made like almonds in one branch, a knop and a flower; so for the six branches which are coming out from the candlestick.

**³⁴** 'And in the candlestick [are] four calyxes made like almonds, its knops and its flowers;

**³⁵** and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, [are] to the six branches which are coming out of the candlestick;

**³⁶** their knops and their branches are of the same, all of it one beaten work of pure gold;

**³⁷** and thou hast made its seven lamps, and [one] hath caused its lights to go up, and it hath given light over-against its front.

**³⁸** 'And its snuffers and its snuff dishes [are] of pure gold;

**³⁹** of a talent of pure gold he doth make it, with all these vessels.

**⁴⁰** And see thou and do [them] by their pattern which thou art shewn in the mount.
