# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> Whither hath thy beloved gone, O fair among women? Whither hath thy beloved turned, And we seek him with thee?

<sup>2</sup> My beloved went down to his garden, To the beds of the spice, To delight himself in the gardens, and to gather lilies.

<sup>3</sup> I [am] my beloved's, and my beloved [is] mine, Who is delighting himself among the lilies.

<sup>4</sup> Fair [art] thou, my friend, as Tirzah, Comely as Jerusalem, Awe-inspiring as bannered hosts.

<sup>5</sup> Turn round thine eyes from before me, Because they have made me proud. Thy hair [is] as a row of the goats, That have shone from Gilead,

<sup>6</sup> Thy teeth as a row of the lambs, That have come up from the washing, Because all of them are forming twins, And a bereaved one is not among them.

<sup>7</sup> As the work of the pomegranate [is] thy temple behind thy veil.

<sup>8</sup> Sixty are queens, and eighty concubines, And virgins without number.

<sup>9</sup> One is my dove, my perfect one, One she [is] of her mother, The choice one she [is] of her that bare her, Daughters saw, and pronounce her happy, Queens and concubines, and they praise her.

<sup>10</sup> 'Who [is] this that is looking forth as morning, Fair as the moon — clear as the sun, Awe-inspiring as bannered hosts?'

<sup>11</sup> Unto a garden of nuts I went down, To look on the buds of the valley, To see whither the vine had flourished, The pomegranates had blossomed —

<sup>12</sup> I knew not my soul, It made me — chariots of my people Nadib.

<sup>13</sup> Return, return, O Shulammith! Return, return, and we look upon thee. What do ye see in Shulammith?
