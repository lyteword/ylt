# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Lo, thou [art] fair, my friend, lo, thou [art] fair, Thine eyes [are] doves behind thy veil, Thy hair as a row of the goats That have shone from mount Gilead,

<sup>2</sup> Thy teeth as a row of the shorn ones That have come up from the washing, For all of them are forming twins, And a bereaved one is not among them.

<sup>3</sup> As a thread of scarlet [are] thy lips, And thy speech [is] comely, As the work of the pomegranate [is] thy temple behind thy veil,

<sup>4</sup> As the tower of David [is] thy neck, built for an armoury, The chief of the shields are hung on it, All shields of the mighty.

<sup>5</sup> Thy two breasts [are] as two fawns, Twins of a roe, that are feeding among lilies.

<sup>6</sup> Till the day doth break forth, And the shadows have fled away, I will get me unto the mountain of myrrh, And unto the hill of frankincense.

<sup>7</sup> Thou [art] all fair, my friend, And a blemish there is not in thee. Come from Lebanon, O spouse,

<sup>8</sup> Come from Lebanon, come thou in. Look from the top of Amana, From the top of Shenir and Hermon, From the habitations of lions, From the mountains of leopards.

<sup>9</sup> Thou hast emboldened me, my sister-spouse, Emboldened me with one of thine eyes, With one chain of thy neck.

<sup>10</sup> How wonderful have been thy loves, my sister-spouse, How much better have been thy loves than wine, And the fragrance of thy perfumes than all spices.

<sup>11</sup> Thy lips drop honey, O spouse, Honey and milk [are] under thy tongue, And the fragrance of thy garments [Is] as the fragrance of Lebanon.

<sup>12</sup> A garden shut up [is] my sister-spouse, A spring shut up — a fountain sealed.

<sup>13</sup> Thy shoots a paradise of pomegranates, With precious fruits,

<sup>14</sup> Cypresses with nard — nard and saffron, Cane and cinnamon, With all trees of frankincense, Myrrh and aloes, with all chief spices.

<sup>15</sup> A fount of gardens, a well of living waters, And flowings from Lebanon!

<sup>16</sup> Awake, O north wind, and come, O south, Cause my garden to breathe forth, its spices let flow, Let my beloved come to his garden, And eat its pleasant fruits!
