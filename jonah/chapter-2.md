# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> And Jonah prayeth unto Jehovah his God from the bowels of the fish.

<sup>2</sup> And he saith: I called, because of my distress, to Jehovah, And He doth answer me, From the belly of sheol I have cried, Thou hast heard my voice.

<sup>3</sup> When Thou dost cast me [into] the deep, Into the heart of the seas, Then the flood doth compass me, All Thy breakers and Thy billows have passed over me.

<sup>4</sup> And I — I said: I have been cast out from before Thine eyes, (Yet I add to look unto Thy holy temple!)

<sup>5</sup> Compassed me have waters unto the soul, The deep doth compass me, The weed is bound to my head.

<sup>6</sup> To the cuttings of mountains I have come down, The earth, her bars [are] behind me to the age. And Thou bringest up from the pit my life, O Jehovah my God.

<sup>7</sup> In the feebleness within me of my soul Jehovah I have remembered, And come in unto Thee doth my prayer, Unto Thy holy temple.

<sup>8</sup> Those observing lying vanities their own mercy forsake.

<sup>9</sup> And I — with a voice of thanksgiving — I sacrifice to Thee, That which I have vowed I complete, Salvation [is] of Jehovah.

<sup>10</sup> And Jehovah saith to the fish, and it vomiteth out Jonah on the dry land.
