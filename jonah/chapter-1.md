# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> And there is a word of Jehovah unto Jonah son of Amittai, saying:

<sup>2</sup> 'Rise, go unto Nineveh, the great city, and proclaim against it that their wickedness hath come up before Me.'

<sup>3</sup> And Jonah riseth to flee to Tarshish from the face of Jehovah, and goeth down [to] Joppa, and findeth a ship going [to] Tarshish, and he giveth its fare, and goeth down into it, to go with them to Tarshish from the face of Jehovah.

<sup>4</sup> And Jehovah hath cast a great wind on the sea, and there is a great tempest in the sea, and the ship hath reckoned to be broken;

<sup>5</sup> and the mariners are afraid, and cry each unto his god, and cast the goods that [are] in the ship into the sea, to make [it] light of them; and Jonah hath gone down unto the sides of the vessel, and he lieth down, and is fast asleep.

<sup>6</sup> And the chief of the company draweth near to him, and saith to him, 'What — to thee, O sleeper? rise, call unto thy God, it may be God doth bethink himself of us, and we do not perish.'

<sup>7</sup> And they say each unto his neighbour, 'Come, and we cast lots, and we know on whose account this evil [is] on us.' And they cast lots, and the lot falleth on Jonah.

<sup>8</sup> And they say unto him, 'Declare to us, we pray thee, on what account this evil [is] on us? what [is] thine occupation, and whence comest thou? what [is] thy country, seeing thou art not of this people?'

<sup>9</sup> And he saith unto them, 'A Hebrew I [am], and Jehovah, God of the heavens, I am reverencing, who made the sea and the dry land.'

<sup>10</sup> And the men fear a great fear, and say unto him, 'What [is] this thou hast done!' for the men have known that from the face of Jehovah he is fleeing, for he hath told them.

<sup>11</sup> And they say unto him, 'What do we do to thee that the sea may cease from us, for the sea is more and more tempestuous?'

<sup>12</sup> And he saith unto them, 'Lift me up, and cast me into the sea, and the sea doth cease from you; for I know that on my account this great tempest [is] upon you.'

<sup>13</sup> And the men row to turn back unto the dry land, and are not able, for the sea is more and more tempestuous against them.

<sup>14</sup> And they cry unto Jehovah, and say, 'We pray Thee, O Jehovah, let us not, we pray Thee, perish for this man's life, and do not lay on us innocent blood, for Thou, Jehovah, as Thou hast pleased, Thou hast done.'

<sup>15</sup> And they lift up Jonah, and cast him into the sea, and the sea ceaseth from its raging;

<sup>16</sup> and the men fear Jehovah — a great fear, and sacrifice a sacrifice to Jehovah, and vow vows.

<sup>17</sup> And Jehovah appointeth a great fish to swallow up Jonah, and Jonah is in the bowels of the fish three days and three nights.
