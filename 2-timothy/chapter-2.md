# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> Thou, therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that [is] in Christ Jesus,

<sup>2</sup> and the things that thou didst hear from me through many witnesses, these things be committing to stedfast men, who shall be sufficient also others to teach;

<sup>3</sup> thou, therefore, suffer evil as a good soldier of Jesus Christ;

<sup>4</sup> no one serving as a soldier did entangle himself with the affairs of life, that him who did enlist him he may please;

<sup>5</sup> and if also any one may strive, he is not crowned, except he may strive lawfully;

<sup>6</sup> the labouring husbandman it behoveth first of the fruits to partake;

<sup>7</sup> be considering what things I say, for the Lord give to thee understanding in all things.

<sup>8</sup> Remember Jesus Christ, raised out of the dead, of the seed of David, according to my good news,

<sup>9</sup> in which I suffer evil — unto bonds, as an evil-doer, but the word of God hath not been bound;

<sup>10</sup> because of this all things do I endure, because of the choice ones, that they also salvation may obtain that [is] in Christ Jesus, with glory age-during.

<sup>11</sup> Stedfast [is] the word: For if we died together — we also shall live together;

<sup>12</sup> if we do endure together — we shall also reign together; if we deny [him], he also shall deny us;

<sup>13</sup> if we are not stedfast, he remaineth stedfast; to deny himself he is not able.

<sup>14</sup> These things remind [them] of, testifying fully before the Lord — not to strive about words to nothing profitable, but to the subversion of those hearing;

<sup>15</sup> be diligent to present thyself approved to God — a workman irreproachable, rightly dividing the word of the truth;

<sup>16</sup> and the profane vain talkings stand aloof from, for to more impiety they will advance,

<sup>17</sup> and their word as a gangrene will have pasture, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus,

<sup>18</sup> who concerning the truth did swerve, saying the rising again to have already been, and do overthrow the faith of some;

<sup>19</sup> sure, nevertheless, hath the foundation of God stood, having this seal, 'The Lord hath known those who are His,' and 'Let him depart from unrighteousness — every one who is naming the name of Christ.'

<sup>20</sup> And in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some to honour, and some to dishonour:

<sup>21</sup> if, then, any one may cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified and profitable to the master — to every good work having been prepared,

<sup>22</sup> and the youthful lusts flee thou, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those calling upon the Lord out of a pure heart;

<sup>23</sup> and the foolish and uninstructed questions be avoiding, having known that they beget strife,

<sup>24</sup> and a servant of the Lord it behoveth not to strive, but to be gentle unto all, apt to teach, patient under evil,

<sup>25</sup> in meekness instructing those opposing — if perhaps God may give to them repentance to an acknowledging of the truth,

<sup>26</sup> and they may awake out of the devil's snare, having been caught by him at his will.
