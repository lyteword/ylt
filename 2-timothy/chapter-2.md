# Chapter 2

**¹** Thou, therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that [is] in Christ Jesus,

**²** and the things that thou didst hear from me through many witnesses, these things be committing to stedfast men, who shall be sufficient also others to teach;

**³** thou, therefore, suffer evil as a good soldier of Jesus Christ;

**⁴** no one serving as a soldier did entangle himself with the affairs of life, that him who did enlist him he may please;

**⁵** and if also any one may strive, he is not crowned, except he may strive lawfully;

**⁶** the labouring husbandman it behoveth first of the fruits to partake;

**⁷** be considering what things I say, for the Lord give to thee understanding in all things.

**⁸** Remember Jesus Christ, raised out of the dead, of the seed of David, according to my good news,

**⁹** in which I suffer evil — unto bonds, as an evil-doer, but the word of God hath not been bound;

**¹⁰** because of this all things do I endure, because of the choice ones, that they also salvation may obtain that [is] in Christ Jesus, with glory age-during.

**¹¹** Stedfast [is] the word: For if we died together — we also shall live together;

**¹²** if we do endure together — we shall also reign together; if we deny [him], he also shall deny us;

**¹³** if we are not stedfast, he remaineth stedfast; to deny himself he is not able.

**¹⁴** These things remind [them] of, testifying fully before the Lord — not to strive about words to nothing profitable, but to the subversion of those hearing;

**¹⁵** be diligent to present thyself approved to God — a workman irreproachable, rightly dividing the word of the truth;

**¹⁶** and the profane vain talkings stand aloof from, for to more impiety they will advance,

**¹⁷** and their word as a gangrene will have pasture, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus,

**¹⁸** who concerning the truth did swerve, saying the rising again to have already been, and do overthrow the faith of some;

**¹⁹** sure, nevertheless, hath the foundation of God stood, having this seal, 'The Lord hath known those who are His,' and 'Let him depart from unrighteousness — every one who is naming the name of Christ.'

**²⁰** And in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some to honour, and some to dishonour:

**²¹** if, then, any one may cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified and profitable to the master — to every good work having been prepared,

**²²** and the youthful lusts flee thou, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those calling upon the Lord out of a pure heart;

**²³** and the foolish and uninstructed questions be avoiding, having known that they beget strife,

**²⁴** and a servant of the Lord it behoveth not to strive, but to be gentle unto all, apt to teach, patient under evil,

**²⁵** in meekness instructing those opposing — if perhaps God may give to them repentance to an acknowledging of the truth,

**²⁶** and they may awake out of the devil's snare, having been caught by him at his will.
