# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> And this know thou, that in the last days there shall come perilous times,

<sup>2</sup> for men shall be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, evil-speakers, to parents disobedient, unthankful, unkind,

<sup>3</sup> without natural affection, implacable, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, not lovers of those who are good,

<sup>4</sup> traitors, heady, lofty, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God,

<sup>5</sup> having a form of piety, and its power having denied; and from these be turning away,

<sup>6</sup> for of these there are those coming into the houses and leading captive the silly women, laden with sins, led away with desires manifold,

<sup>7</sup> always learning, and never to a knowledge of truth able to come,

<sup>8</sup> and, even as Jannes and Jambres stood against Moses, so also these do stand against the truth, men corrupted in mind, disapproved concerning the faith;

<sup>9</sup> but they shall not advance any further, for their folly shall be manifest to all, as theirs also did become.

<sup>10</sup> And thou — thou hast followed after my teaching, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, endurance,

<sup>11</sup> the persecutions, the afflictions, that befell me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of all the Lord did deliver me,

<sup>12</sup> and all also who will to live piously in Christ Jesus shall be persecuted,

<sup>13</sup> and evil men and impostors shall advance to the worse, leading astray and being led astray.

<sup>14</sup> And thou — be remaining in the things which thou didst learn and wast entrusted with, having known from whom thou didst learn,

<sup>15</sup> and because from a babe the Holy Writings thou hast known, which are able to make thee wise — to salvation, through faith that [is] in Christ Jesus;

<sup>16</sup> every Writing [is] God-breathed, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for setting aright, for instruction that [is] in righteousness,

<sup>17</sup> that the man of God may be fitted — for every good work having been completed.
