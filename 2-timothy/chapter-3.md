# Chapter 3

**¹** And this know thou, that in the last days there shall come perilous times,

**²** for men shall be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, evil-speakers, to parents disobedient, unthankful, unkind,

**³** without natural affection, implacable, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, not lovers of those who are good,

**⁴** traitors, heady, lofty, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God,

**⁵** having a form of piety, and its power having denied; and from these be turning away,

**⁶** for of these there are those coming into the houses and leading captive the silly women, laden with sins, led away with desires manifold,

**⁷** always learning, and never to a knowledge of truth able to come,

**⁸** and, even as Jannes and Jambres stood against Moses, so also these do stand against the truth, men corrupted in mind, disapproved concerning the faith;

**⁹** but they shall not advance any further, for their folly shall be manifest to all, as theirs also did become.

**¹⁰** And thou — thou hast followed after my teaching, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, endurance,

**¹¹** the persecutions, the afflictions, that befell me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of all the Lord did deliver me,

**¹²** and all also who will to live piously in Christ Jesus shall be persecuted,

**¹³** and evil men and impostors shall advance to the worse, leading astray and being led astray.

**¹⁴** And thou — be remaining in the things which thou didst learn and wast entrusted with, having known from whom thou didst learn,

**¹⁵** and because from a babe the Holy Writings thou hast known, which are able to make thee wise — to salvation, through faith that [is] in Christ Jesus;

**¹⁶** every Writing [is] God-breathed, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for setting aright, for instruction that [is] in righteousness,

**¹⁷** that the man of God may be fitted — for every good work having been completed.
