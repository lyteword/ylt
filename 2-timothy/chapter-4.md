# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> I do fully testify, then, before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is about to judge living and dead at his manifestation and his reign —

<sup>2</sup> preach the word; be earnest in season, out of season, convict, rebuke, exhort, in all long-suffering and teaching,

<sup>3</sup> for there shall be a season when the sound teaching they will not suffer, but according to their own desires to themselves they shall heap up teachers — itching in the hearing,

<sup>4</sup> and indeed, from the truth the hearing they shall turn away, and to the fables they shall be turned aside.

<sup>5</sup> And thou — watch in all things; suffer evil; do the work of one proclaiming good news; of thy ministration make full assurance,

<sup>6</sup> for I am already being poured out, and the time of my release hath arrived;

<sup>7</sup> the good strife I have striven, the course I have finished, the faith I have kept,

<sup>8</sup> henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of the righteousness that the Lord — the Righteous Judge — shall give to me in that day, and not only to me, but also to all those loving his manifestation.

<sup>9</sup> Be diligent to come unto me quickly,

<sup>10</sup> for Demas forsook me, having loved the present age, and went on to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia,

<sup>11</sup> Lukas only is with me; Markus having taken, bring with thyself, for he is profitable to me for ministration;

<sup>12</sup> and Tychicus I sent to Ephesus;

<sup>13</sup> the cloak that I left in Troas with Carpus, coming, bring thou and the books — especially the parchments.

<sup>14</sup> Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil; may the Lord repay to him according to his works,

<sup>15</sup> of whom also do thou beware, for greatly hath he stood against our words;

<sup>16</sup> in my first defence no one stood with me, but all forsook me, (may it not be reckoned to them!)

<sup>17</sup> and the Lord stood by me, and did strengthen me, that through me the preaching might be fully assured, and all the nations might hear, and I was freed out of the mouth of a lion,

<sup>18</sup> and the Lord shall free me from every evil work, and shall save [me] — to his heavenly kingdom; to whom [is] the glory to the ages of the ages! Amen.

<sup>19</sup> Salute Prisca and Aquilas, and Onesiphorus' household;

<sup>20</sup> Erastus did remain in Corinth, and Trophimus I left in Miletus infirm;

<sup>21</sup> be diligent to come before winter. Salute thee doth Eubulus, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.

<sup>22</sup> The Lord Jesus Christ [is] with thy spirit; the grace [is] with you! Amen.
