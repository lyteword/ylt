# Psalm 97

<sup>1</sup> Jehovah hath reigned, The earth is joyful, many isles rejoice.

<sup>2</sup> Cloud and darkness [are] round about Him, Righteousness and judgment the basis of His throne.

<sup>3</sup> Fire before Him goeth, And burneth round about His adversaries.

<sup>4</sup> Lightened have His lightnings the world, The earth hath seen, and is pained.

<sup>5</sup> Hills, like wax, melted before Jehovah, Before the Lord of all the earth.

<sup>6</sup> The heavens declared His righteousness, And all the peoples have seen His honour.

<sup>7</sup> Ashamed are all servants of a graven image, Those boasting themselves in idols, Bow yourselves to him, all ye gods.

<sup>8</sup> Zion hath heard and rejoiceth, And daughters of Judah are joyful, Because of Thy judgments, O Jehovah.

<sup>9</sup> For Thou, Jehovah, [art] Most High over all the earth, Greatly Thou hast been exalted over all gods.

<sup>10</sup> Ye who love Jehovah, hate evil, He is keeping the souls of His saints, From the hand of the wicked he delivereth them.

<sup>11</sup> Light [is] sown for the righteous, And for the upright of heart — joy.

<sup>12</sup> Rejoice, ye righteous, in Jehovah, And give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness!
