# Psalm 97 

**¹** Jehovah hath reigned, The earth is joyful, many isles rejoice.

**²** Cloud and darkness [are] round about Him, Righteousness and judgment the basis of His throne.

**³** Fire before Him goeth, And burneth round about His adversaries.

**⁴** Lightened have His lightnings the world, The earth hath seen, and is pained.

**⁵** Hills, like wax, melted before Jehovah, Before the Lord of all the earth.

**⁶** The heavens declared His righteousness, And all the peoples have seen His honour.

**⁷** Ashamed are all servants of a graven image, Those boasting themselves in idols, Bow yourselves to him, all ye gods.

**⁸** Zion hath heard and rejoiceth, And daughters of Judah are joyful, Because of Thy judgments, O Jehovah.

**⁹** For Thou, Jehovah, [art] Most High over all the earth, Greatly Thou hast been exalted over all gods.

**¹⁰** Ye who love Jehovah, hate evil, He is keeping the souls of His saints, From the hand of the wicked he delivereth them.

**¹¹** Light [is] sown for the righteous, And for the upright of heart — joy.

**¹²** Rejoice, ye righteous, in Jehovah, And give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness!
