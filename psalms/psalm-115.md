# Psalm 115

**¹** Not to us, O Jehovah, not to us, But to Thy name give honour, For Thy kindness, for Thy truth.

**²** Why do the nations say, 'Where, pray, [is] their God.

**³** And our God [is] in the heavens, All that He hath pleased He hath done.

**⁴** Their idols [are] silver and gold, work of man's hands,

**⁵** A mouth they have, and they speak not, Eyes they have, and they see not,

**⁶** Ears they have, and they hear not, A nose they have, and they smell not,

**⁷** Their hands, but they handle not, Their feet, and they walk not;

**⁸** Nor do they mutter through their throat, Like them are their makers, Every one who is trusting in them.

**⁹** O Israel, trust in Jehovah, 'Their help and their shield [is] He.'

**¹⁰** O house of Aaron, trust in Jehovah, 'Their help and their shield [is] He.'

**¹¹** Ye fearing Jehovah, trust in Jehovah, 'Their help and their shield [is] He.'

**¹²** Jehovah hath remembered us, He blesseth, He blesseth the house of Israel, He blesseth the house of Aaron,

**¹³** He blesseth those fearing Jehovah, The small with the great.

**¹⁴** Jehovah addeth to you, to you, and to your sons.

**¹⁵** Blessed [are] ye of Jehovah, maker of heaven and earth,

**¹⁶** The heavens — the heavens [are] Jehovah's, And the earth He hath given to sons of men,

**¹⁷** The dead praise not Jah, Nor any going down to silence.

**¹⁸** And we, we bless Jah, From henceforth, and unto the age. Praise ye Jah!
