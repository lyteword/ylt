# Psalm 115

<sup>1</sup> Not to us, O Jehovah, not to us, But to Thy name give honour, For Thy kindness, for Thy truth.

<sup>2</sup> Why do the nations say, 'Where, pray, [is] their God.

<sup>3</sup> And our God [is] in the heavens, All that He hath pleased He hath done.

<sup>4</sup> Their idols [are] silver and gold, work of man's hands,

<sup>5</sup> A mouth they have, and they speak not, Eyes they have, and they see not,

<sup>6</sup> Ears they have, and they hear not, A nose they have, and they smell not,

<sup>7</sup> Their hands, but they handle not, Their feet, and they walk not;

<sup>8</sup> Nor do they mutter through their throat, Like them are their makers, Every one who is trusting in them.

<sup>9</sup> O Israel, trust in Jehovah, 'Their help and their shield [is] He.'

<sup>10</sup> O house of Aaron, trust in Jehovah, 'Their help and their shield [is] He.'

<sup>11</sup> Ye fearing Jehovah, trust in Jehovah, 'Their help and their shield [is] He.'

<sup>12</sup> Jehovah hath remembered us, He blesseth, He blesseth the house of Israel, He blesseth the house of Aaron,

<sup>13</sup> He blesseth those fearing Jehovah, The small with the great.

<sup>14</sup> Jehovah addeth to you, to you, and to your sons.

<sup>15</sup> Blessed [are] ye of Jehovah, maker of heaven and earth,

<sup>16</sup> The heavens — the heavens [are] Jehovah's, And the earth He hath given to sons of men,

<sup>17</sup> The dead praise not Jah, Nor any going down to silence.

<sup>18</sup> And we, we bless Jah, From henceforth, and unto the age. Praise ye Jah!
