# Psalm 33

<sup>1</sup> Sing, ye righteous, in Jehovah, For upright ones praise [is] comely.

<sup>2</sup> Give ye thanks to Jehovah with a harp, With psaltery of ten strings sing praise to Him,

<sup>3</sup> Sing ye to Him a new song, Play skilfully with shouting.

<sup>4</sup> For upright [is] the word of Jehovah, And all His work [is] in faithfulness.

<sup>5</sup> Loving righteousness and judgment, Of the kindness of Jehovah is the earth full.

<sup>6</sup> By the word of Jehovah The heavens have been made, And by the breath of His mouth all their host.

<sup>7</sup> Gathering as a heap the waters of the sea, Putting in treasuries the depths.

<sup>8</sup> Afraid of Jehovah are all the earth, Of Him are all the inhabitants of the world afraid.

<sup>9</sup> For He hath said, and it is, He hath commanded, and it standeth.

<sup>10</sup> Jehovah made void the counsel of nations, He disallowed the thoughts of the peoples.

<sup>11</sup> The counsel of Jehovah to the age standeth, The thoughts of His heart to all generations.

<sup>12</sup> O the happiness of the nation whose God [is] Jehovah, Of the people He did choose, For an inheritance to Him.

<sup>13</sup> From the heavens hath Jehovah looked, He hath seen all the sons of men.

<sup>14</sup> From the fixed place of His dwelling, He looked unto all inhabitants of the earth;

<sup>15</sup> Who is forming their hearts together, Who is attending unto all their works.

<sup>16</sup> The king is not saved by the multitude of a force. A mighty man is not delivered, By abundance of power.

<sup>17</sup> A false thing [is] the horse for safety, And by the abundance of his strength He doth not deliver.

<sup>18</sup> Lo, the eye of Jehovah [is] to those fearing Him, To those waiting for His kindness,

<sup>19</sup> To deliver from death their soul, And to keep them alive in famine.

<sup>20</sup> Our soul hath waited for Jehovah, Our help and our shield [is] He,

<sup>21</sup> For in Him doth our heart rejoice, For in His holy name we have trusted.

<sup>22</sup> Let Thy kindness, O Jehovah, be upon us, As we have waited for Thee!
