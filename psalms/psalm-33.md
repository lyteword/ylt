# Psalm 33 

**¹** Sing, ye righteous, in Jehovah, For upright ones praise [is] comely.

**²** Give ye thanks to Jehovah with a harp, With psaltery of ten strings sing praise to Him,

**³** Sing ye to Him a new song, Play skilfully with shouting.

**⁴** For upright [is] the word of Jehovah, And all His work [is] in faithfulness.

**⁵** Loving righteousness and judgment, Of the kindness of Jehovah is the earth full.

**⁶** By the word of Jehovah The heavens have been made, And by the breath of His mouth all their host.

**⁷** Gathering as a heap the waters of the sea, Putting in treasuries the depths.

**⁸** Afraid of Jehovah are all the earth, Of Him are all the inhabitants of the world afraid.

**⁹** For He hath said, and it is, He hath commanded, and it standeth.

**¹⁰** Jehovah made void the counsel of nations, He disallowed the thoughts of the peoples.

**¹¹** The counsel of Jehovah to the age standeth, The thoughts of His heart to all generations.

**¹²** O the happiness of the nation whose God [is] Jehovah, Of the people He did choose, For an inheritance to Him.

**¹³** From the heavens hath Jehovah looked, He hath seen all the sons of men.

**¹⁴** From the fixed place of His dwelling, He looked unto all inhabitants of the earth;

**¹⁵** Who is forming their hearts together, Who is attending unto all their works.

**¹⁶** The king is not saved by the multitude of a force. A mighty man is not delivered, By abundance of power.

**¹⁷** A false thing [is] the horse for safety, And by the abundance of his strength He doth not deliver.

**¹⁸** Lo, the eye of Jehovah [is] to those fearing Him, To those waiting for His kindness,

**¹⁹** To deliver from death their soul, And to keep them alive in famine.

**²⁰** Our soul hath waited for Jehovah, Our help and our shield [is] He,

**²¹** For in Him doth our heart rejoice, For in His holy name we have trusted.

**²²** Let Thy kindness, O Jehovah, be upon us, As we have waited for Thee!
