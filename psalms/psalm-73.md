# Psalm 73

**¹** A Psalm of Asaph. Only — good to Israel [is] God, to the clean of heart. And I — as a little thing, My feet have been turned aside,

**²** As nothing, have my steps slipped, For I have been envious of the boastful,

**³** The peace of the wicked I see, That there are no bands at their death,

**⁴** And their might [is] firm.

**⁵** In the misery of mortals they are not, And with common men they are not plagued.

**⁶** Therefore hath pride encircled them, Violence covereth them as a dress.

**⁷** Their eye hath come out from fat. The imaginations of the heart transgressed;

**⁸** They do corruptly, And they speak in the wickedness of oppression, From on high they speak.

**⁹** They have set in the heavens their mouth, And their tongue walketh in the earth.

**¹⁰** Therefore do His people return hither, And waters of fulness are wrung out to them.

**¹¹** And they have said, 'How hath God known? And is there knowledge in the Most High?'

**¹²** Lo, these [are] the wicked and easy ones of the age, They have increased strength.

**¹³** Only — a vain thing! I have purified my heart, And I wash in innocency my hands,

**¹⁴** And I am plagued all the day, And my reproof [is] every morning.

**¹⁵** If I have said, 'I recount thus,' Lo, a generation of Thy sons I have deceived.

**¹⁶** And I think to know this, Perverseness it [is] in mine eyes,

**¹⁷** Till I come in to the sanctuaries of God, I attend to their latter end.

**¹⁸** Only, in slippery places Thou dost set them, Thou hast caused them to fall to desolations.

**¹⁹** How have they become a desolation as in a moment, They have been ended — consumed from terrors.

**²⁰** As a dream from awakening, O Lord, In awaking, their image Thou despisest.

**²¹** For my heart doth show itself violent, And my reins prick themselves,

**²²** And I am brutish, and do not know. A beast I have been with Thee.

**²³** And I [am] continually with Thee, Thou hast laid hold on my right hand.

**²⁴** With Thy counsel Thou dost lead me, And after honour dost receive me.

**²⁵** Whom have I in the heavens? And with Thee none I have desired in earth.

**²⁶** Consumed hath been my flesh and my heart, The rock of my heart and my portion [is] God to the age.

**²⁷** For, lo, those far from Thee do perish, Thou hast cut off every one, Who is going a whoring from Thee.

**²⁸** And I — nearness of God to me [is] good, I have placed in the Lord Jehovah my refuge, To recount all Thy works!
