# Psalm 73

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of Asaph. Only — good to Israel [is] God, to the clean of heart. And I — as a little thing, My feet have been turned aside,

<sup>2</sup> As nothing, have my steps slipped, For I have been envious of the boastful,

<sup>3</sup> The peace of the wicked I see, That there are no bands at their death,

<sup>4</sup> And their might [is] firm.

<sup>5</sup> In the misery of mortals they are not, And with common men they are not plagued.

<sup>6</sup> Therefore hath pride encircled them, Violence covereth them as a dress.

<sup>7</sup> Their eye hath come out from fat. The imaginations of the heart transgressed;

<sup>8</sup> They do corruptly, And they speak in the wickedness of oppression, From on high they speak.

<sup>9</sup> They have set in the heavens their mouth, And their tongue walketh in the earth.

<sup>10</sup> Therefore do His people return hither, And waters of fulness are wrung out to them.

<sup>11</sup> And they have said, 'How hath God known? And is there knowledge in the Most High?'

<sup>12</sup> Lo, these [are] the wicked and easy ones of the age, They have increased strength.

<sup>13</sup> Only — a vain thing! I have purified my heart, And I wash in innocency my hands,

<sup>14</sup> And I am plagued all the day, And my reproof [is] every morning.

<sup>15</sup> If I have said, 'I recount thus,' Lo, a generation of Thy sons I have deceived.

<sup>16</sup> And I think to know this, Perverseness it [is] in mine eyes,

<sup>17</sup> Till I come in to the sanctuaries of God, I attend to their latter end.

<sup>18</sup> Only, in slippery places Thou dost set them, Thou hast caused them to fall to desolations.

<sup>19</sup> How have they become a desolation as in a moment, They have been ended — consumed from terrors.

<sup>20</sup> As a dream from awakening, O Lord, In awaking, their image Thou despisest.

<sup>21</sup> For my heart doth show itself violent, And my reins prick themselves,

<sup>22</sup> And I am brutish, and do not know. A beast I have been with Thee.

<sup>23</sup> And I [am] continually with Thee, Thou hast laid hold on my right hand.

<sup>24</sup> With Thy counsel Thou dost lead me, And after honour dost receive me.

<sup>25</sup> Whom have I in the heavens? And with Thee none I have desired in earth.

<sup>26</sup> Consumed hath been my flesh and my heart, The rock of my heart and my portion [is] God to the age.

<sup>27</sup> For, lo, those far from Thee do perish, Thou hast cut off every one, Who is going a whoring from Thee.

<sup>28</sup> And I — nearness of God to me [is] good, I have placed in the Lord Jehovah my refuge, To recount all Thy works!
