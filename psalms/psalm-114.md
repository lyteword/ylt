# Psalm 114

<sup>1</sup> In the going out of Israel from Egypt, The house of Jacob from a strange people,

<sup>2</sup> Judah became His sanctuary, Israel his dominion.

<sup>3</sup> The sea hath seen, and fleeth, The Jordan turneth backward.

<sup>4</sup> The mountains have skipped as rams, Heights as sons of a flock.

<sup>5</sup> What — to thee, O sea, that thou fleest? O Jordan, thou turnest back!

<sup>6</sup> O mountains, ye skip as rams! O heights, as sons of a flock!

<sup>7</sup> From before the Lord be afraid, O earth, From before the God of Jacob,

<sup>8</sup> He is turning the rock to a pool of waters, The flint to a fountain of waters!
