# Psalm 121

<sup>1</sup> A Song of the Ascents. I lift up mine eyes unto the hills, Whence doth my help come?

<sup>2</sup> My help [is] from Jehovah, maker of heaven and earth,

<sup>3</sup> He suffereth not thy foot to be moved, Thy preserver slumbereth not.

<sup>4</sup> Lo, He slumbereth not, nor sleepeth, He who is preserving Israel.

<sup>5</sup> Jehovah [is] thy preserver, Jehovah [is] thy shade on thy right hand,

<sup>6</sup> By day the sun doth not smite thee, Nor the moon by night.

<sup>7</sup> Jehovah preserveth thee from all evil, He doth preserve thy soul.

<sup>8</sup> Jehovah preserveth thy going out and thy coming in, From henceforth even unto the age!
