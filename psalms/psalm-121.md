# Psalm 121

**¹** A Song of the Ascents. I lift up mine eyes unto the hills, Whence doth my help come?

**²** My help [is] from Jehovah, maker of heaven and earth,

**³** He suffereth not thy foot to be moved, Thy preserver slumbereth not.

**⁴** Lo, He slumbereth not, nor sleepeth, He who is preserving Israel.

**⁵** Jehovah [is] thy preserver, Jehovah [is] thy shade on thy right hand,

**⁶** By day the sun doth not smite thee, Nor the moon by night.

**⁷** Jehovah preserveth thee from all evil, He doth preserve thy soul.

**⁸** Jehovah preserveth thy going out and thy coming in, From henceforth even unto the age!
