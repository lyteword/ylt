# Psalm 113

<sup>1</sup> Praise ye Jah! Praise, ye servants of Jehovah. Praise the name of Jehovah.

<sup>2</sup> The name of Jehovah is blessed, From henceforth, and unto the age.

<sup>3</sup> From the rising of the sun unto its going in, Praised [is] the name of Jehovah.

<sup>4</sup> High above all nations [is] Jehovah, Above the heavens [is] his honour.

<sup>5</sup> Who [is] as Jehovah our God, He is exalting [Himself] to sit?

<sup>6</sup> He is humbling [Himself] to look On the heavens and on the earth.

<sup>7</sup> He is raising up from the dust the poor, From a dunghill He exalteth the needy.

<sup>8</sup> To cause to sit with princes, With the princes of His people.

<sup>9</sup> Causing the barren one of the house to sit, A joyful mother of sons; praise ye Jah!
