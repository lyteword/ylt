# Psalm 113 

**¹** Praise ye Jah! Praise, ye servants of Jehovah. Praise the name of Jehovah.

**²** The name of Jehovah is blessed, From henceforth, and unto the age.

**³** From the rising of the sun unto its going in, Praised [is] the name of Jehovah.

**⁴** High above all nations [is] Jehovah, Above the heavens [is] his honour.

**⁵** Who [is] as Jehovah our God, He is exalting [Himself] to sit?

**⁶** He is humbling [Himself] to look On the heavens and on the earth.

**⁷** He is raising up from the dust the poor, From a dunghill He exalteth the needy.

**⁸** To cause to sit with princes, With the princes of His people.

**⁹** Causing the barren one of the house to sit, A joyful mother of sons; praise ye Jah!
