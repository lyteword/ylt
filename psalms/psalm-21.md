# Psalm 21

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer. — A Psalm of David. Jehovah, in Thy strength is the king joyful, In Thy salvation how greatly he rejoiceth.

<sup>2</sup> The desire of his heart Thou gavest to him, And the request of his lips Thou hast not withheld. Selah.

<sup>3</sup> For Thou puttest before him blessings of goodness, Thou settest on his head a crown of fine gold.

<sup>4</sup> Life he hath asked from Thee, Thou hast given to him — length of days, Age-during — and for ever.

<sup>5</sup> Great [is] his honour in Thy salvation, Honour and majesty Thou placest on him.

<sup>6</sup> For Thou makest him blessings for ever, Thou dost cause him to rejoice with joy, By Thy countenance.

<sup>7</sup> For the king is trusting in Jehovah, And in the kindness of the Most High He is not moved.

<sup>8</sup> Thy hand cometh to all Thine enemies, Thy right hand doth find Thy haters.

<sup>9</sup> Thou makest them as a furnace of fire, At the time of Thy presence. Jehovah in His anger doth swallow them, And fire doth devour them.

<sup>10</sup> Their fruit from earth Thou destroyest, And their seed from the sons of men.

<sup>11</sup> For they stretched out against Thee evil, They devised a wicked device, they prevail not,

<sup>12</sup> For Thou makest them a butt, When Thy strings Thou preparest against their faces.

<sup>13</sup> Be Thou exalted, O Jehovah in, Thy strength, We sing and we praise Thy might!
