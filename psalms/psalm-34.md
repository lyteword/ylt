# Psalm 34 

**¹** By David, in his changing his behaviour before Abimelech, and he driveth him away, and he goeth. I do bless Jehovah at all times, Continually His praise [is] in my mouth.

**²** In Jehovah doth my soul boast herself, Hear do the humble and rejoice.

**³** Ascribe ye greatness to Jehovah with me, And we exalt His name together.

**⁴** I sought Jehovah, and He answered me, And from all my fears did deliver me.

**⁵** They looked expectingly unto Him, And they became bright, And their faces are not ashamed.

**⁶** This poor [one] called, and Jehovah heard, And from all his distresses saved him.

**⁷** A messenger of Jehovah is encamping, Round about those who fear Him, And He armeth them.

**⁸** Taste ye and see that Jehovah [is] good, O the happiness of the man who trusteth in Him.

**⁹** Fear Jehovah, ye His holy ones, For there is no lack to those fearing Him.

**¹⁰** Young lions have lacked and been hungry, And those seeking Jehovah lack not any good,

**¹¹** Come ye, children, hearken to me, The fear of Jehovah I do teach you.

**¹²** Who [is] the man that is desiring life? Loving days to see good?

**¹³** Keep thy tongue from evil, And thy lips from speaking deceit.

**¹⁴** Turn aside from evil and do good, Seek peace and pursue it.

**¹⁵** The eyes of Jehovah [are] unto the righteous, And His ears unto their cry.

**¹⁶** (The face of Jehovah [is] on doers of evil, To cut off from earth their memorial.)

**¹⁷** They cried, and Jehovah heard, And from all their distresses delivered them.

**¹⁸** Near [is] Jehovah to the broken of heart, And the bruised of spirit He saveth.

**¹⁹** Many [are] the evils of the righteous, Out of them all doth Jehovah deliver him.

**²⁰** He is keeping all his bones, One of them hath not been broken.

**²¹** Evil doth put to death the wicked, And those hating the righteous are desolate.

**²²** Jehovah redeemeth the soul of His servants, And none trusting in Him are desolate!
