# Psalm 34

<sup>1</sup> By David, in his changing his behaviour before Abimelech, and he driveth him away, and he goeth. I do bless Jehovah at all times, Continually His praise [is] in my mouth.

<sup>2</sup> In Jehovah doth my soul boast herself, Hear do the humble and rejoice.

<sup>3</sup> Ascribe ye greatness to Jehovah with me, And we exalt His name together.

<sup>4</sup> I sought Jehovah, and He answered me, And from all my fears did deliver me.

<sup>5</sup> They looked expectingly unto Him, And they became bright, And their faces are not ashamed.

<sup>6</sup> This poor [one] called, and Jehovah heard, And from all his distresses saved him.

<sup>7</sup> A messenger of Jehovah is encamping, Round about those who fear Him, And He armeth them.

<sup>8</sup> Taste ye and see that Jehovah [is] good, O the happiness of the man who trusteth in Him.

<sup>9</sup> Fear Jehovah, ye His holy ones, For there is no lack to those fearing Him.

<sup>10</sup> Young lions have lacked and been hungry, And those seeking Jehovah lack not any good,

<sup>11</sup> Come ye, children, hearken to me, The fear of Jehovah I do teach you.

<sup>12</sup> Who [is] the man that is desiring life? Loving days to see good?

<sup>13</sup> Keep thy tongue from evil, And thy lips from speaking deceit.

<sup>14</sup> Turn aside from evil and do good, Seek peace and pursue it.

<sup>15</sup> The eyes of Jehovah [are] unto the righteous, And His ears unto their cry.

<sup>16</sup> (The face of Jehovah [is] on doers of evil, To cut off from earth their memorial.)

<sup>17</sup> They cried, and Jehovah heard, And from all their distresses delivered them.

<sup>18</sup> Near [is] Jehovah to the broken of heart, And the bruised of spirit He saveth.

<sup>19</sup> Many [are] the evils of the righteous, Out of them all doth Jehovah deliver him.

<sup>20</sup> He is keeping all his bones, One of them hath not been broken.

<sup>21</sup> Evil doth put to death the wicked, And those hating the righteous are desolate.

<sup>22</sup> Jehovah redeemeth the soul of His servants, And none trusting in Him are desolate!
