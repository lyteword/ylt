# Psalm 19

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer. — A Psalm of David. The heavens [are] recounting the honour of God, And the work of His hands The expanse [is] declaring.

<sup>2</sup> Day to day uttereth speech, And night to night sheweth knowledge.

<sup>3</sup> There is no speech, and there are no words. Their voice hath not been heard.

<sup>4</sup> Into all the earth hath their line gone forth, And to the end of the world their sayings, For the sun He placed a tent in them,

<sup>5</sup> And he, as a bridegroom, goeth out from his covering, He rejoiceth as a mighty one To run the path.

<sup>6</sup> From the end of the heavens [is] his going out, And his revolution [is] unto their ends, And nothing is hid from his heat.

<sup>7</sup> The law of Jehovah [is] perfect, refreshing the soul, The testimonies of Jehovah [are] stedfast, Making wise the simple,

<sup>8</sup> The precepts of Jehovah [are] upright, Rejoicing the heart, The command of Jehovah [is] pure, enlightening the eyes,

<sup>9</sup> The fear of Jehovah [is] clean, standing to the age, The judgments of Jehovah [are] true, They have been righteous — together.

<sup>10</sup> They are more desirable than gold, Yea, than much fine gold; and sweeter than honey, Even liquid honey of the comb.

<sup>11</sup> Also — Thy servant is warned by them, 'In keeping them [is] a great reward.'

<sup>12</sup> Errors! who doth understand? From hidden ones declare me innocent,

<sup>13</sup> Also — from presumptuous ones keep back Thy servant, Let them not rule over me, Then am I perfect, And declared innocent of much transgression,

<sup>14</sup> Let the sayings of my mouth, And the meditation of my heart, Be for a pleasing thing before Thee, O Jehovah, my rock, and my redeemer!
