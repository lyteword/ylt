# Psalm 93

**¹** Jehovah hath reigned, Excellency He hath put on, Jehovah put on strength, He girded Himself, Also — established is the world, unmoved.

**²** Established is Thy throne since then, From the age Thou [art].

**³** Floods have lifted up, O Jehovah, Floods have lifted up their voice, Floods lift up their breakers.

**⁴** Than the voices of many mighty waters, Breakers of a sea, mighty on high [is] Jehovah,

**⁵** Thy testimonies have been very stedfast, To Thy house comely [is] holiness, O Jehovah, for length of days!
