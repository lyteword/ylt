# Psalm 66 

**¹** To the Overseer. — A Song, a Psalm. Shout ye to God, all the earth.

**²** Praise ye the honour of His name, Make ye honourable His praise.

**³** Say to God, 'How fearful [are] Thy works, By the abundance of Thy strength, Thine enemies feign obedience to Thee.

**⁴** All the earth do bow to Thee, They sing praise to Thee, they praise Thy name.' Selah.

**⁵** Come ye, and see the works of God, Fearful acts toward the sons of men.

**⁶** He hath turned a sea to dry land, Through a river they pass over on foot, There do we rejoice in Him.

**⁷** Ruling by His might to the age, His eyes among the nations do watch, The refractory exalt not themselves. Selah.

**⁸** Bless, ye peoples, our God, And sound the voice of His praise,

**⁹** Who hath placed our soul in life, And suffered not our feet to be moved.

**¹⁰** For Thou hast tried us, O God, Thou hast refined us as the refining of silver.

**¹¹** Thou hast brought us into a net, Thou hast placed pressure on our loins.

**¹²** Thou hast caused man to ride at our head. We have entered into fire and into water, And Thou bringest us out to a watered place.

**¹³** I enter Thy house with burnt-offerings, I complete to Thee my vows,

**¹⁴** For opened were my lips, And my mouth spake in my distress:

**¹⁵** 'Burnt-offerings of fatlings I offer to Thee, With perfume of rams, I prepare a bullock with he-goats.' Selah.

**¹⁶** Come, hear, all ye who fear God, And I recount what he did for my soul.

**¹⁷** Unto Him [with] my mouth I have called, And exaltation [is] under my tongue.

**¹⁸** Iniquity, if I have seen in my heart, The Lord doth not hear.

**¹⁹** But God hath heard, He hath attended to the voice of my prayer.

**²⁰** Blessed [is] God, Who hath not turned aside my prayer, And His loving-kindness, from me!
