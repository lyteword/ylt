# Psalm 66

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer. — A Song, a Psalm. Shout ye to God, all the earth.

<sup>2</sup> Praise ye the honour of His name, Make ye honourable His praise.

<sup>3</sup> Say to God, 'How fearful [are] Thy works, By the abundance of Thy strength, Thine enemies feign obedience to Thee.

<sup>4</sup> All the earth do bow to Thee, They sing praise to Thee, they praise Thy name.' Selah.

<sup>5</sup> Come ye, and see the works of God, Fearful acts toward the sons of men.

<sup>6</sup> He hath turned a sea to dry land, Through a river they pass over on foot, There do we rejoice in Him.

<sup>7</sup> Ruling by His might to the age, His eyes among the nations do watch, The refractory exalt not themselves. Selah.

<sup>8</sup> Bless, ye peoples, our God, And sound the voice of His praise,

<sup>9</sup> Who hath placed our soul in life, And suffered not our feet to be moved.

<sup>10</sup> For Thou hast tried us, O God, Thou hast refined us as the refining of silver.

<sup>11</sup> Thou hast brought us into a net, Thou hast placed pressure on our loins.

<sup>12</sup> Thou hast caused man to ride at our head. We have entered into fire and into water, And Thou bringest us out to a watered place.

<sup>13</sup> I enter Thy house with burnt-offerings, I complete to Thee my vows,

<sup>14</sup> For opened were my lips, And my mouth spake in my distress:

<sup>15</sup> 'Burnt-offerings of fatlings I offer to Thee, With perfume of rams, I prepare a bullock with he-goats.' Selah.

<sup>16</sup> Come, hear, all ye who fear God, And I recount what he did for my soul.

<sup>17</sup> Unto Him [with] my mouth I have called, And exaltation [is] under my tongue.

<sup>18</sup> Iniquity, if I have seen in my heart, The Lord doth not hear.

<sup>19</sup> But God hath heard, He hath attended to the voice of my prayer.

<sup>20</sup> Blessed [is] God, Who hath not turned aside my prayer, And His loving-kindness, from me!
