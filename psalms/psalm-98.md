# Psalm 98

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm. Sing ye to Jehovah a new song, For wonders He hath done, Given salvation to Him hath His right hand and His holy arm.

<sup>2</sup> Jehovah hath made known His salvation, Before the eyes of the nations, He hath revealed His righteousness,

<sup>3</sup> He hath remembered His kindness, And His faithfulness to the house of Israel, All ends of earth have seen the salvation of our God.

<sup>4</sup> Shout to Jehovah, all the earth, Break forth, and cry aloud, and sing.

<sup>5</sup> Sing to Jehovah with harp, With harp, and voice of praise,

<sup>6</sup> With trumpets, and voice of a cornet, Shout ye before the king Jehovah.

<sup>7</sup> Roar doth the sea and its fulness, The world and the inhabitants in it.

<sup>8</sup> Floods clap hand, together hills cry aloud,

<sup>9</sup> Before Jehovah, For He hath come to judge the earth, He judgeth the world in righteousness, And the people in uprightness!
