# Psalm 137 

**¹** By rivers of Babylon — There we did sit, Yea, we wept when we remembered Zion.

**²** On willows in its midst we hung our harps.

**³** For there our captors asked us the words of a song, And our spoilers — joy: 'Sing ye to us of a song of Zion.'

**⁴** How do we sing the song of Jehovah, On the land of a stranger?

**⁵** If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, my right hand forgetteth!

**⁶** My tongue doth cleave to my palate, If I do not remember thee, If I do not exalt Jerusalem above my chief joy.

**⁷** Remember, Jehovah, for the sons of Edom, The day of Jerusalem, Those saying, 'Rase, rase to its foundation!'

**⁸** O daughter of Babylon, O destroyed one, O the happiness of him who repayeth to thee thy deed, That thou hast done to us.

**⁹** O the happiness of him who doth seize, And hath dashed thy sucklings on the rock!
