<sup>2</sup> O the happiness of those keeping His testimonies, With the whole heart they seek Him.

<sup>3</sup> Yea, they have not done iniquity, In His ways they have walked.

<sup>4</sup> Thou hast commanded us Thy precepts to keep diligently,

<sup>5</sup> O that my ways were prepared to keep Thy statutes,

<sup>6</sup> Then I am not ashamed In my looking unto all Thy commands.
