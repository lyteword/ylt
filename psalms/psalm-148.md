# Psalm 148

**¹** Praise ye Jah! Praise ye Jehovah from the heavens, Praise ye Him in high places.

**²** Praise ye Him, all His messengers, Praise ye Him, all His hosts.

**³** Praise ye Him, sun and moon, Praise ye Him, all stars of light.

**⁴** Praise ye Him, heavens of heavens, And ye waters that are above the heavens.

**⁵** They do praise the name of Jehovah, For He commanded, and they were created.

**⁶** And He establisheth them for ever to the age, A statute He gave, and they pass not over.

**⁷** Praise ye Jehovah from the earth, Dragons and all deeps,

**⁸** Fire and hail, snow and vapour, Whirlwind doing His word;

**⁹** The mountains and all heights, Fruit tree, and all cedars,

**¹⁰** The wild beast, and all cattle, Creeping thing, and winged bird,

**¹¹** Kings of earth, and all peoples, Chiefs, and all judges of earth,

**¹²** Young men, and also maidens, Aged men, with youths,

**¹³** They praise the name of Jehovah, For His name alone hath been set on high, His honour [is] above earth and heavens.

**¹⁴** And He exalteth the horn of His people, The praise of all His saints, Of the sons of Israel, a people near Him. Praise ye Jah!
