# Psalm 148

<sup>1</sup> Praise ye Jah! Praise ye Jehovah from the heavens, Praise ye Him in high places.

<sup>2</sup> Praise ye Him, all His messengers, Praise ye Him, all His hosts.

<sup>3</sup> Praise ye Him, sun and moon, Praise ye Him, all stars of light.

<sup>4</sup> Praise ye Him, heavens of heavens, And ye waters that are above the heavens.

<sup>5</sup> They do praise the name of Jehovah, For He commanded, and they were created.

<sup>6</sup> And He establisheth them for ever to the age, A statute He gave, and they pass not over.

<sup>7</sup> Praise ye Jehovah from the earth, Dragons and all deeps,

<sup>8</sup> Fire and hail, snow and vapour, Whirlwind doing His word;

<sup>9</sup> The mountains and all heights, Fruit tree, and all cedars,

<sup>10</sup> The wild beast, and all cattle, Creeping thing, and winged bird,

<sup>11</sup> Kings of earth, and all peoples, Chiefs, and all judges of earth,

<sup>12</sup> Young men, and also maidens, Aged men, with youths,

<sup>13</sup> They praise the name of Jehovah, For His name alone hath been set on high, His honour [is] above earth and heavens.

<sup>14</sup> And He exalteth the horn of His people, The praise of all His saints, Of the sons of Israel, a people near Him. Praise ye Jah!
