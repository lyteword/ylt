# Psalm 9

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer, 'On the Death of Labben.' — A Psalm of David. I confess, O Jehovah, with all my heart, I recount all Thy wonders,

<sup>2</sup> I rejoice and exult in Thee, I praise Thy Name, O Most High.

<sup>3</sup> In mine enemies turning backward, they stumble and perish from Thy face.

<sup>4</sup> For Thou hast done my judgment and my right. Thou hast sat on a throne, A judge of righteousness.

<sup>5</sup> Thou hast rebuked nations, Thou hast destroyed the wicked, Their name Thou hast blotted out to the age and for ever.

<sup>6</sup> O thou Enemy, Finished have been destructions for ever, As to cities thou hast plucked up, Perished hath their memorial with them.

<sup>7</sup> And Jehovah to the age abideth, He is preparing for judgment His throne.

<sup>8</sup> And He judgeth the world in righteousness, He judgeth the peoples in uprightness.

<sup>9</sup> And Jehovah is a tower for the bruised, A tower for times of adversity.

<sup>10</sup> They trust in Thee who do know Thy name, For Thou hast not forsaken Those seeking Thee, O Jehovah.

<sup>11</sup> Sing ye praise to Jehovah, inhabiting Zion, Declare ye among the peoples His acts,

<sup>12</sup> For He who is seeking for blood Them hath remembered, He hath not forgotten the cry of the afflicted.

<sup>13</sup> Favour me, O Jehovah, See mine affliction by those hating me, Thou who liftest me up from the gates of death,

<sup>14</sup> So that I recount all Thy praise, In the gates of the daughter of Zion. I rejoice on Thy salvation.

<sup>15</sup> Sunk have nations in a pit they made, In a net that they hid hath their foot been captured.

<sup>16</sup> Jehovah hath been known, Judgment He hath done, By a work of his hands Hath the wicked been snared. Meditation. Selah.

<sup>17</sup> The wicked do turn back to Sheol, All nations forgetting God.

<sup>18</sup> For not for ever is the needy forgotten, The hope of the humble lost to the age.

<sup>19</sup> Rise, O Jehovah, let not man be strong, Let nations be judged before Thy face.

<sup>20</sup> Appoint, O Jehovah, a director to them, Let nations know they [are] men! Selah.
