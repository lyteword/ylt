# Psalm 9

**¹** To the Overseer, 'On the Death of Labben.' — A Psalm of David. I confess, O Jehovah, with all my heart, I recount all Thy wonders,

**²** I rejoice and exult in Thee, I praise Thy Name, O Most High.

**³** In mine enemies turning backward, they stumble and perish from Thy face.

**⁴** For Thou hast done my judgment and my right. Thou hast sat on a throne, A judge of righteousness.

**⁵** Thou hast rebuked nations, Thou hast destroyed the wicked, Their name Thou hast blotted out to the age and for ever.

**⁶** O thou Enemy, Finished have been destructions for ever, As to cities thou hast plucked up, Perished hath their memorial with them.

**⁷** And Jehovah to the age abideth, He is preparing for judgment His throne.

**⁸** And He judgeth the world in righteousness, He judgeth the peoples in uprightness.

**⁹** And Jehovah is a tower for the bruised, A tower for times of adversity.

**¹⁰** They trust in Thee who do know Thy name, For Thou hast not forsaken Those seeking Thee, O Jehovah.

**¹¹** Sing ye praise to Jehovah, inhabiting Zion, Declare ye among the peoples His acts,

**¹²** For He who is seeking for blood Them hath remembered, He hath not forgotten the cry of the afflicted.

**¹³** Favour me, O Jehovah, See mine affliction by those hating me, Thou who liftest me up from the gates of death,

**¹⁴** So that I recount all Thy praise, In the gates of the daughter of Zion. I rejoice on Thy salvation.

**¹⁵** Sunk have nations in a pit they made, In a net that they hid hath their foot been captured.

**¹⁶** Jehovah hath been known, Judgment He hath done, By a work of his hands Hath the wicked been snared. Meditation. Selah.

**¹⁷** The wicked do turn back to Sheol, All nations forgetting God.

**¹⁸** For not for ever is the needy forgotten, The hope of the humble lost to the age.

**¹⁹** Rise, O Jehovah, let not man be strong, Let nations be judged before Thy face.

**²⁰** Appoint, O Jehovah, a director to them, Let nations know they [are] men! Selah.
