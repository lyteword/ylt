# Psalm 132

**¹** A Song of the Ascents. Remember, Jehovah, for David, all his afflictions.

**²** Who hath sworn to Jehovah. He hath vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:

**³** 'If I enter into the tent of my house, If I go up on the couch of my bed,

**⁴** If I give sleep to mine eyes, To mine eyelids — slumber,

**⁵** Till I do find a place for Jehovah, Tabernacles for the Mighty One of Jacob.

**⁶** 'Lo, we have heard it in Ephratah, We have found it in the fields of the forest.

**⁷** We come in to His tabernacles, We bow ourselves at His footstool.

**⁸** Arise, O Jehovah, to Thy rest, Thou, and the ark of Thy strength,

**⁹** Thy priests do put on righteousness, And Thy pious ones cry aloud.

**¹⁰** For the sake of David Thy servant, Turn not back the face of Thine anointed.

**¹¹** Jehovah hath sworn truth to David, He turneth not back from it: Of the fruit of thy body, I set on the throne for thee.

**¹²** If thy sons keep My covenant, And My testimonies that I teach them, Their sons also for ever and ever, Do sit on the throne for thee.

**¹³** For Jehovah hath fixed on Zion, He hath desired [it] for a seat to Himself,

**¹⁴** This [is] My rest for ever and ever, Here do I sit, for I have desired it.

**¹⁵** Her provision I greatly bless, Her needy ones I satisfy [with] bread,

**¹⁶** And her priests I clothe [with] salvation, And her pious ones do sing aloud.

**¹⁷** There I cause to spring up a horn for David, I have arranged a lamp for Mine anointed.

**¹⁸** His enemies I do clothe [with] shame, And upon him doth his crown flourish!
