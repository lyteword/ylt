# Psalm 132

<sup>1</sup> A Song of the Ascents. Remember, Jehovah, for David, all his afflictions.

<sup>2</sup> Who hath sworn to Jehovah. He hath vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:

<sup>3</sup> 'If I enter into the tent of my house, If I go up on the couch of my bed,

<sup>4</sup> If I give sleep to mine eyes, To mine eyelids — slumber,

<sup>5</sup> Till I do find a place for Jehovah, Tabernacles for the Mighty One of Jacob.

<sup>6</sup> 'Lo, we have heard it in Ephratah, We have found it in the fields of the forest.

<sup>7</sup> We come in to His tabernacles, We bow ourselves at His footstool.

<sup>8</sup> Arise, O Jehovah, to Thy rest, Thou, and the ark of Thy strength,

<sup>9</sup> Thy priests do put on righteousness, And Thy pious ones cry aloud.

<sup>10</sup> For the sake of David Thy servant, Turn not back the face of Thine anointed.

<sup>11</sup> Jehovah hath sworn truth to David, He turneth not back from it: Of the fruit of thy body, I set on the throne for thee.

<sup>12</sup> If thy sons keep My covenant, And My testimonies that I teach them, Their sons also for ever and ever, Do sit on the throne for thee.

<sup>13</sup> For Jehovah hath fixed on Zion, He hath desired [it] for a seat to Himself,

<sup>14</sup> This [is] My rest for ever and ever, Here do I sit, for I have desired it.

<sup>15</sup> Her provision I greatly bless, Her needy ones I satisfy [with] bread,

<sup>16</sup> And her priests I clothe [with] salvation, And her pious ones do sing aloud.

<sup>17</sup> There I cause to spring up a horn for David, I have arranged a lamp for Mine anointed.

<sup>18</sup> His enemies I do clothe [with] shame, And upon him doth his crown flourish!
