# Psalm 123

<sup>1</sup> A Song of the Ascents. Unto Thee I have lifted up mine eyes, O dweller in the heavens.

<sup>2</sup> Lo, as eyes of men-servants [Are] unto the hand of their masters, As eyes of a maid-servant [Are] unto the hand of her mistress, So [are] our eyes unto Jehovah our God, Till that He doth favour us.

<sup>3</sup> Favour us, O Jehovah, favour us, For greatly have we been filled with contempt,

<sup>4</sup> Greatly hath our soul been filled With the scorning of the easy ones, With the contempt of the arrogant!
