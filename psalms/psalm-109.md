# Psalm 109

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer. — A Psalm of David. O God of my praise, be not silent,

<sup>2</sup> For the mouth of wickedness, and the mouth of deceit, Against me they have opened, They have spoken with me — A tongue of falsehood, and words of hatred!

<sup>3</sup> They have compassed me about, And they fight me without cause.

<sup>4</sup> For my love they oppose me, and I — prayer!

<sup>5</sup> And they set against me evil for good, And hatred for my love.

<sup>6</sup> Appoint Thou over him the wicked, And an adversary standeth at his right hand.

<sup>7</sup> In his being judged, he goeth forth wicked, And his prayer is for sin.

<sup>8</sup> His days are few, his oversight another taketh,

<sup>9</sup> His sons are fatherless, and his wife a widow.

<sup>10</sup> And wander continually do his sons, Yea, they have begged, And have sought out of their dry places.

<sup>11</sup> An exactor layeth a snare for all that he hath, And strangers spoil his labour.

<sup>12</sup> He hath none to extend kindness, Nor is there one showing favour to his orphans.

<sup>13</sup> His posterity is for cutting off, In another generation is their name blotted out.

<sup>14</sup> The iniquity of his fathers Is remembered unto Jehovah, And the sin of his mother is not blotted out.

<sup>15</sup> They are before Jehovah continually, And He cutteth off from earth their memorial.

<sup>16</sup> Because that he hath not remembered to do kindness, And pursueth the poor man and needy, And the smitten of heart — to slay,

<sup>17</sup> And he loveth reviling, and it meeteth him, And he hath not delighted in blessing, And it is far from him.

<sup>18</sup> And he putteth on reviling as his robe, And it cometh in as water into his midst, And as oil into his bones.

<sup>19</sup> It is to him as apparel — he covereth himself, And for a continual girdle he girdeth it on.

<sup>20</sup> This [is] the wage of mine accusers from Jehovah, And of those speaking evil against my soul.

<sup>21</sup> And Thou, O Jehovah Lord, Deal with me for Thy name's sake, Because Thy kindness [is] good, deliver me.

<sup>22</sup> For I [am] poor and needy, And my heart hath been pierced in my midst.

<sup>23</sup> As a shadow when it is stretched out I have gone, I have been driven away as a locust.

<sup>24</sup> My knees have been feeble from fasting, And my flesh hath failed of fatness.

<sup>25</sup> And I — I have been a reproach to them, They see me, they shake their head.

<sup>26</sup> Help me, O Jehovah my God, Save me, according to Thy kindness.

<sup>27</sup> And they know that this [is] Thy hand, Thou, O Jehovah, Thou hast done it.

<sup>28</sup> They revile, and Thou dost bless, They have risen, and are ashamed, And Thy servant doth rejoice.

<sup>29</sup> Mine accusers put on blushing, and are covered, As an upper robe [is] their shame.

<sup>30</sup> I thank Jehovah greatly with my mouth, And in the midst of many I praise Him,

<sup>31</sup> For He standeth at the right hand of the needy, To save from those judging his soul.
