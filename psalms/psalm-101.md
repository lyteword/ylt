# Psalm 101

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. Kindness and judgment I sing, To Thee, O Jehovah, I sing praise.

<sup>2</sup> I act wisely in a perfect way, When dost Thou come in unto me? I walk habitually in the integrity of my heart, In the midst of my house.

<sup>3</sup> I set not before mine eyes a worthless thing, The work of those turning aside I have hated, It adhereth not to me.

<sup>4</sup> A perverse heart turneth aside from me, Wickedness I know not.

<sup>5</sup> Whoso slandereth in secret his neighbour, Him I cut off, The high of eyes and proud of heart, him I endure not.

<sup>6</sup> Mine eyes are on the faithful of the land, To dwell with me, Whoso is walking in a perfect way, he serveth me.

<sup>7</sup> He dwelleth not in my house who is working deceit, Whoso is speaking lies Is not established before mine eyes.

<sup>8</sup> At morning I cut off all the wicked of the land, To cut off from the city of Jehovah All the workers of iniquity!
