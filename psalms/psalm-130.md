# Psalm 130

<sup>1</sup> A Song of the Ascents. From depths I have called Thee, Jehovah.

<sup>2</sup> Lord, hearken to my voice, Thine ears are attentive to the voice of my supplications.

<sup>3</sup> If iniquities Thou dost observe, O Lord, who doth stand?

<sup>4</sup> But with Thee [is] forgiveness, that Thou mayest be feared.

<sup>5</sup> I hoped [for] Jehovah — hoped hath my soul, And for His word I have waited.

<sup>6</sup> My soul [is] for the Lord, More than those watching for morning, Watching for morning!

<sup>7</sup> Israel doth wait on Jehovah, For with Jehovah [is] kindness, And abundant with Him [is] redemption.

<sup>8</sup> And He doth redeem Israel from all his iniquities!
