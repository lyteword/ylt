# Psalm 130 

**¹** A Song of the Ascents. From depths I have called Thee, Jehovah.

**²** Lord, hearken to my voice, Thine ears are attentive to the voice of my supplications.

**³** If iniquities Thou dost observe, O Lord, who doth stand?

**⁴** But with Thee [is] forgiveness, that Thou mayest be feared.

**⁵** I hoped [for] Jehovah — hoped hath my soul, And for His word I have waited.

**⁶** My soul [is] for the Lord, More than those watching for morning, Watching for morning!

**⁷** Israel doth wait on Jehovah, For with Jehovah [is] kindness, And abundant with Him [is] redemption.

**⁸** And He doth redeem Israel from all his iniquities!
