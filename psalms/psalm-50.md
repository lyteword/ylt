# Psalm 50

**¹** A Psalm of Asaph. The God of gods — Jehovah — hath spoken, And He calleth to the earth From the rising of the sun unto its going in.

**²** From Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shone.

**³** Our God cometh, and is not silent, Fire before Him doth devour, And round about him it hath been very tempestuous.

**⁴** He doth call unto the heavens from above, And unto the earth, to judge His people.

**⁵** Gather ye to Me My saints, Making covenant with Me over a sacrifice.

**⁶** And the heavens declare His righteousness, For God Himself [is] judge. Selah.

**⁷** Hear, O My people, and I speak, O Israel, and I testify against thee, God, thy God [am] I.

**⁸** Not for thy sacrifices do I reprove thee, Yea, thy burnt-offerings [Are] before Me continually.

**⁹** I take not from thy house a bullock, From thy folds he goats.

**¹⁰** For Mine [is] every beast of the forest, The cattle on the hills of oxen.

**¹¹** I have known every fowl of the mountains, And the wild beast of the field [is] with Me.

**¹²** If I am hungry I tell not to thee, For Mine [is] the world and its fulness.

**¹³** Do I eat the flesh of bulls, And drink the blood of he-goats?

**¹⁴** Sacrifice to God confession, And complete to the Most High thy vows.

**¹⁵** And call Me in a day of adversity, I deliver thee, and thou honourest Me.

**¹⁶** And to the wicked hath God said: What to thee — to recount My statutes? That thou liftest up My covenant on thy mouth?

**¹⁷** Yea, thou hast hated instruction, And dost cast My words behind thee.

**¹⁸** If thou hast seen a thief, Then thou art pleased with him, And with adulterers [is] thy portion.

**¹⁹** Thy mouth thou hast sent forth with evil, And thy tongue joineth deceit together,

**²⁰** Thou sittest, against thy brother thou speakest, Against a son of thy mother givest slander.

**²¹** These thou didst, and I kept silent, Thou hast thought that I am like thee, I reprove thee, and set in array before thine eyes.

**²²** Understand this, I pray you, Ye who are forgetting God, Lest I tear, and there is no deliverer.

**²³** He who is sacrificing praise honoureth Me, As to him who maketh a way, I cause him to look on the salvation of God!
