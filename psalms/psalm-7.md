# Psalm 7

**¹** 'The Erring One,' by David, that he sung to Jehovah concerning the words of Cush a Benjamite. O Jehovah, my God, in Thee I have trusted, Save me from all my pursuers, and deliver me.

**²** Lest he tear as a lion my soul, Rending, and there is no deliverer.

**³** O Jehovah, my God, if I have done this, If there is iniquity in my hands,

**⁴** If I have done my well-wisher evil, And draw mine adversary without cause,

**⁵** An enemy pursueth my soul, and overtaketh, And treadeth down to the earth my life, And my honour placeth in the dust. Selah.

**⁶** Rise, O Jehovah, in Thine anger, Be lifted up at the wrath of mine adversaries, And awake Thou for me: Judgment Thou hast commanded:

**⁷** And a company of peoples compass Thee, And over it on high turn Thou back,

**⁸** Jehovah doth judge the peoples; Judge me, O Jehovah, According to my righteousness, And according to mine integrity on me,

**⁹** Let, I pray Thee be ended the evil of the wicked, And establish Thou the righteous, And a trier of hearts and reins is the righteous God.

**¹⁰** My shield [is] on God, Saviour of the upright in heart!

**¹¹** God [is] a righteous judge, And He is not angry at all times.

**¹²** If [one] turn not, His sword he sharpeneth, His bow he hath trodden — He prepareth it,

**¹³** Yea, for him He hath prepared Instruments of death, His arrows for burning pursuers He maketh.

**¹⁴** Lo, he travaileth [with] iniquity, And he hath conceived perverseness, And hath brought forth falsehood.

**¹⁵** A pit he hath prepared, and he diggeth it, And he falleth into a ditch he maketh.

**¹⁶** Return doth his perverseness on his head, And on his crown his violence cometh down.

**¹⁷** I thank Jehovah, According to His righteousness, And praise the name of Jehovah Most High!
