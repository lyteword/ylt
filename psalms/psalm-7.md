# Psalm 7

<sup>1</sup> 'The Erring One,' by David, that he sung to Jehovah concerning the words of Cush a Benjamite. O Jehovah, my God, in Thee I have trusted, Save me from all my pursuers, and deliver me.

<sup>2</sup> Lest he tear as a lion my soul, Rending, and there is no deliverer.

<sup>3</sup> O Jehovah, my God, if I have done this, If there is iniquity in my hands,

<sup>4</sup> If I have done my well-wisher evil, And draw mine adversary without cause,

<sup>5</sup> An enemy pursueth my soul, and overtaketh, And treadeth down to the earth my life, And my honour placeth in the dust. Selah.

<sup>6</sup> Rise, O Jehovah, in Thine anger, Be lifted up at the wrath of mine adversaries, And awake Thou for me: Judgment Thou hast commanded:

<sup>7</sup> And a company of peoples compass Thee, And over it on high turn Thou back,

<sup>8</sup> Jehovah doth judge the peoples; Judge me, O Jehovah, According to my righteousness, And according to mine integrity on me,

<sup>9</sup> Let, I pray Thee be ended the evil of the wicked, And establish Thou the righteous, And a trier of hearts and reins is the righteous God.

<sup>10</sup> My shield [is] on God, Saviour of the upright in heart!

<sup>11</sup> God [is] a righteous judge, And He is not angry at all times.

<sup>12</sup> If [one] turn not, His sword he sharpeneth, His bow he hath trodden — He prepareth it,

<sup>13</sup> Yea, for him He hath prepared Instruments of death, His arrows for burning pursuers He maketh.

<sup>14</sup> Lo, he travaileth [with] iniquity, And he hath conceived perverseness, And hath brought forth falsehood.

<sup>15</sup> A pit he hath prepared, and he diggeth it, And he falleth into a ditch he maketh.

<sup>16</sup> Return doth his perverseness on his head, And on his crown his violence cometh down.

<sup>17</sup> I thank Jehovah, According to His righteousness, And praise the name of Jehovah Most High!
