# Psalm 25

<sup>1</sup> By David. Unto Thee, O Jehovah, my soul I lift up.

<sup>2</sup> My God, in Thee I have trusted, Let me not be ashamed, Let not mine enemies exult over me.

<sup>3</sup> Also let none waiting on Thee be ashamed, Let the treacherous dealers without cause be ashamed.

<sup>4</sup> Thy ways, O Jehovah, cause me to know, Thy paths teach Thou me.

<sup>5</sup> Cause me to tread in Thy truth, and teach me, For Thou [art] the God of my salvation, Near Thee I have waited all the day.

<sup>6</sup> Remember Thy mercies, O Jehovah, And Thy kindnesses, for from the age [are] they.

<sup>7</sup> Sins of my youth, and my transgressions, Do not Thou remember. According to Thy kindness be mindful of me, For Thy goodness' sake, O Jehovah.

<sup>8</sup> Good and upright [is] Jehovah, Therefore He directeth sinners in the way.

<sup>9</sup> He causeth the humble to tread in judgment, And teacheth the humble His way.

<sup>10</sup> All the paths of Jehovah [are] kindness and truth, To those keeping His covenant, And His testimonies.

<sup>11</sup> For Thy name's sake, O Jehovah, Thou hast pardoned mine iniquity, for it [is] great.

<sup>12</sup> Who [is] this — the man fearing Jehovah? He directeth him in the way He doth choose.

<sup>13</sup> His soul in good doth remain, And his seed doth possess the land.

<sup>14</sup> The secret of Jehovah [is] for those fearing Him, And His covenant — to cause them to know.

<sup>15</sup> Mine eyes [are] continually unto Jehovah, For He bringeth out from a net my feet.

<sup>16</sup> Turn Thou unto me, and favour me, For lonely and afflicted [am] I.

<sup>17</sup> The distresses of my heart have enlarged themselves, From my distresses bring me out.

<sup>18</sup> See mine affliction and my misery, And bear with all my sins.

<sup>19</sup> See my enemies, for they have been many, And with violent hatred they have hated me.

<sup>20</sup> Keep my soul, and deliver me, Let me not be ashamed, for I trusted in Thee.

<sup>21</sup> Integrity and uprightness do keep me, For I have waited [on] Thee.

<sup>22</sup> Redeem Israel, O God, from all his distresses!
