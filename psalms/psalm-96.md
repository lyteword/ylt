# Psalm 96

<sup>1</sup> Sing to Jehovah a new song, Sing to Jehovah all the earth.

<sup>2</sup> Sing to Jehovah, bless His name, Proclaim from day to day His salvation.

<sup>3</sup> Declare among nations His honour, Among all the peoples His wonders.

<sup>4</sup> For great [is] Jehovah, and praised greatly, Fearful He [is] over all gods.

<sup>5</sup> For all the gods of the peoples [are] nought, And Jehovah made the heavens.

<sup>6</sup> Honour and majesty [are] before Him, Strength and beauty in His sanctuary.

<sup>7</sup> Ascribe to Jehovah, O families of the peoples, Ascribe to Jehovah honour and strength.

<sup>8</sup> Ascribe to Jehovah the honour of His name, Lift up a present and come in to His courts.

<sup>9</sup> Bow yourselves to Jehovah, In the honour of holiness, Be afraid of His presence, all the earth.

<sup>10</sup> Say among nations, 'Jehovah hath reigned, Also — established is the world, unmoved, He judgeth the peoples in uprightness.'

<sup>11</sup> The heavens joy, and the earth is joyful, The sea and its fulness roar.

<sup>12</sup> The field exulteth, and all that [is] in it, Then sing do all trees of the forest,

<sup>13</sup> Before Jehovah, for He hath come, For He hath come to judge the earth. He judgeth the world in righteousness, And the peoples in His faithfulness!
