# Psalm 96

**¹** Sing to Jehovah a new song, Sing to Jehovah all the earth.

**²** Sing to Jehovah, bless His name, Proclaim from day to day His salvation.

**³** Declare among nations His honour, Among all the peoples His wonders.

**⁴** For great [is] Jehovah, and praised greatly, Fearful He [is] over all gods.

**⁵** For all the gods of the peoples [are] nought, And Jehovah made the heavens.

**⁶** Honour and majesty [are] before Him, Strength and beauty in His sanctuary.

**⁷** Ascribe to Jehovah, O families of the peoples, Ascribe to Jehovah honour and strength.

**⁸** Ascribe to Jehovah the honour of His name, Lift up a present and come in to His courts.

**⁹** Bow yourselves to Jehovah, In the honour of holiness, Be afraid of His presence, all the earth.

**¹⁰** Say among nations, 'Jehovah hath reigned, Also — established is the world, unmoved, He judgeth the peoples in uprightness.'

**¹¹** The heavens joy, and the earth is joyful, The sea and its fulness roar.

**¹²** The field exulteth, and all that [is] in it, Then sing do all trees of the forest,

**¹³** Before Jehovah, for He hath come, For He hath come to judge the earth. He judgeth the world in righteousness, And the peoples in His faithfulness!
