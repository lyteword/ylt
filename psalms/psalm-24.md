# Psalm 24

**¹** A Psalm of David. To Jehovah [is] the earth and its fulness, The world and the inhabitants in it.

**²** For He on the seas hath founded it, And on the floods He doth establish it.

**³** Who goeth up into the hill of Jehovah? And who riseth up in His holy place?

**⁴** The clean of hands, and pure of heart, Who hath not lifted up to vanity his soul, Nor hath sworn to deceit.

**⁵** He beareth away a blessing from Jehovah, Righteousness from the God of his salvation.

**⁶** This [is] a generation of those seeking Him. Seeking Thy face, O Jacob! Selah.

**⁷** Lift up, O gates, your heads, And be lifted up, O doors age-during, And come in doth the king of glory!

**⁸** Who [is] this — 'the king of glory?' Jehovah — strong and mighty, Jehovah, the mighty in battle.

**⁹** Lift up, O gates, your heads, And be lifted up, O doors age-during, And come in doth the king of glory!

**¹⁰** Who [is] He — this 'king of glory?' Jehovah of hosts — He [is] the king of glory! Selah.
