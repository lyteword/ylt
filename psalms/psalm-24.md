# Psalm 24

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. To Jehovah [is] the earth and its fulness, The world and the inhabitants in it.

<sup>2</sup> For He on the seas hath founded it, And on the floods He doth establish it.

<sup>3</sup> Who goeth up into the hill of Jehovah? And who riseth up in His holy place?

<sup>4</sup> The clean of hands, and pure of heart, Who hath not lifted up to vanity his soul, Nor hath sworn to deceit.

<sup>5</sup> He beareth away a blessing from Jehovah, Righteousness from the God of his salvation.

<sup>6</sup> This [is] a generation of those seeking Him. Seeking Thy face, O Jacob! Selah.

<sup>7</sup> Lift up, O gates, your heads, And be lifted up, O doors age-during, And come in doth the king of glory!

<sup>8</sup> Who [is] this — 'the king of glory?' Jehovah — strong and mighty, Jehovah, the mighty in battle.

<sup>9</sup> Lift up, O gates, your heads, And be lifted up, O doors age-during, And come in doth the king of glory!

<sup>10</sup> Who [is] He — this 'king of glory?' Jehovah of hosts — He [is] the king of glory! Selah.
