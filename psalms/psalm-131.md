# Psalm 131

<sup>1</sup> A Song of the Ascents, by David. Jehovah, my heart hath not been haughty, Nor have mine eyes been high, Nor have I walked in great things, And in things too wonderful for me.

<sup>2</sup> Have I not compared, and kept silent my soul, As a weaned one by its mother? As a weaned one by me [is] my soul.

<sup>3</sup> Israel doth wait on Jehovah, From henceforth, and unto the age!
