# Psalm 131 

**¹** A Song of the Ascents, by David. Jehovah, my heart hath not been haughty, Nor have mine eyes been high, Nor have I walked in great things, And in things too wonderful for me.

**²** Have I not compared, and kept silent my soul, As a weaned one by its mother? As a weaned one by me [is] my soul.

**³** Israel doth wait on Jehovah, From henceforth, and unto the age!
