# Psalm 116

<sup>1</sup> I have loved, because Jehovah heareth My voice, my supplication,

<sup>2</sup> Because He hath inclined His ear to me, And during my days I call.

<sup>3</sup> Compassed me have cords of death, And straits of Sheol have found me, Distress and sorrow I find.

<sup>4</sup> And in the name of Jehovah I call: I pray Thee, O Jehovah, deliver my soul,

<sup>5</sup> Gracious [is] Jehovah, and righteous, Yea, our God [is] merciful,

<sup>6</sup> A preserver of the simple [is] Jehovah, I was low, and to me He giveth salvation.

<sup>7</sup> Turn back, O my soul, to thy rest, For Jehovah hath conferred benefits on thee.

<sup>8</sup> For Thou hast delivered my soul from death, My eyes from tears, my feet from overthrowing.

<sup>9</sup> I walk habitually before Jehovah In the lands of the living.

<sup>10</sup> I have believed, for I speak, I — I have been afflicted greatly.

<sup>11</sup> I said in my haste, 'Every man [is] a liar.'

<sup>12</sup> What do I return to Jehovah? All His benefits [are] upon me.

<sup>13</sup> The cup of salvation I lift up, And in the name of Jehovah I call.

<sup>14</sup> My vows to Jehovah let me complete, I pray you, before all His people.

<sup>15</sup> Precious in the eyes of Jehovah [is] the death for His saints.

<sup>16</sup> Cause [it] to come, O Jehovah, for I [am] Thy servant. I [am] Thy servant, son of Thy handmaid, Thou hast opened my bonds.

<sup>17</sup> To Thee I sacrifice a sacrifice of thanks, And in the name of Jehovah I call.

<sup>18</sup> My vows to Jehovah let me complete, I pray you, before all His people,

<sup>19</sup> In the courts of the house of Jehovah, In thy midst, O Jerusalem, praise ye Jah!
