# Psalm 116 

**¹** I have loved, because Jehovah heareth My voice, my supplication,

**²** Because He hath inclined His ear to me, And during my days I call.

**³** Compassed me have cords of death, And straits of Sheol have found me, Distress and sorrow I find.

**⁴** And in the name of Jehovah I call: I pray Thee, O Jehovah, deliver my soul,

**⁵** Gracious [is] Jehovah, and righteous, Yea, our God [is] merciful,

**⁶** A preserver of the simple [is] Jehovah, I was low, and to me He giveth salvation.

**⁷** Turn back, O my soul, to thy rest, For Jehovah hath conferred benefits on thee.

**⁸** For Thou hast delivered my soul from death, My eyes from tears, my feet from overthrowing.

**⁹** I walk habitually before Jehovah In the lands of the living.

**¹⁰** I have believed, for I speak, I — I have been afflicted greatly.

**¹¹** I said in my haste, 'Every man [is] a liar.'

**¹²** What do I return to Jehovah? All His benefits [are] upon me.

**¹³** The cup of salvation I lift up, And in the name of Jehovah I call.

**¹⁴** My vows to Jehovah let me complete, I pray you, before all His people.

**¹⁵** Precious in the eyes of Jehovah [is] the death for His saints.

**¹⁶** Cause [it] to come, O Jehovah, for I [am] Thy servant. I [am] Thy servant, son of Thy handmaid, Thou hast opened my bonds.

**¹⁷** To Thee I sacrifice a sacrifice of thanks, And in the name of Jehovah I call.

**¹⁸** My vows to Jehovah let me complete, I pray you, before all His people,

**¹⁹** In the courts of the house of Jehovah, In thy midst, O Jerusalem, praise ye Jah!
