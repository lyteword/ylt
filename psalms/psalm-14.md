# Psalm 14

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer. — By David. A fool hath said in his heart, 'God is not;' They have done corruptly, They have done abominable actions, There is not a doer of good.

<sup>2</sup> Jehovah from the heavens Hath looked on the sons of men, To see if there is a wise one — seeking God.

<sup>3</sup> The whole have turned aside, Together they have been filthy: There is not a doer of good, not even one.

<sup>4</sup> Have all working iniquity not known? Those consuming my people have eaten bread, Jehovah they have not called.

<sup>5</sup> There they have feared a fear, For God [is] in the generation of the righteous.

<sup>6</sup> The counsel of the poor ye cause to stink, Because Jehovah [is] his refuge.

<sup>7</sup> 'Who doth give from Zion the salvation of Israel? When Jehovah doth turn back [To] a captivity of His people, Jacob doth rejoice — Israel is glad!
