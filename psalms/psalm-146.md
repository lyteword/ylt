# Psalm 146 

**¹** Praise ye Jah! Praise, O my soul, Jehovah.

**²** I praise Jehovah during my life, I sing praise to my God while I exist.

**³** Trust not in princes — in a son of man, For he hath no deliverance.

**⁴** His spirit goeth forth, he returneth to his earth, In that day have his thoughts perished.

**⁵** O the happiness of him Who hath the God of Jacob for his help, His hope [is] on Jehovah his God,

**⁶** Making the heavens and earth, The sea and all that [is] in them, Who is keeping truth to the age,

**⁷** Doing judgment for the oppressed, Giving bread to the hungry.

**⁸** Jehovah is loosing the prisoners, Jehovah is opening (the eyes of) the blind, Jehovah is raising the bowed down, Jehovah is loving the righteous,

**⁹** Jehovah is preserving the strangers, The fatherless and widow He causeth to stand, And the way of the wicked He turneth upside down.

**¹⁰** Jehovah doth reign to the age, Thy God, O Zion, to generation and generation, Praise ye Jah!
