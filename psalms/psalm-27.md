# Psalm 27

<sup>1</sup> By David. Jehovah [is] my light and my salvation, Whom do I fear? Jehovah [is] the strength of my life, Of whom am I afraid?

<sup>2</sup> When evil doers come near to me to eat my flesh, My adversaries and mine enemies to me, They have stumbled and fallen.

<sup>3</sup> Though a host doth encamp against me, My heart doth not fear, Though war riseth up against me, In this I [am] confident.

<sup>4</sup> One [thing] I asked of Jehovah — it I seek. My dwelling in the house of Jehovah, All the days of my life, To look on the pleasantness of Jehovah, And to inquire in His temple.

<sup>5</sup> For He hideth me in a tabernacle in the day of evil, He hideth me in a secret place of His tent, On a rock he raiseth me up.

<sup>6</sup> And now, lifted up is my head, Above my enemies — my surrounders, And I sacrifice in His tent sacrifices of shouting, I sing, yea, I sing praise to Jehovah.

<sup>7</sup> Hear, O Jehovah, my voice — I call, And favour me, and answer me.

<sup>8</sup> To Thee said my heart 'They sought my face, Thy face, O Jehovah, I seek.'

<sup>9</sup> Hide not Thy face from me, Turn not aside in anger Thy servant, My help Thou hast been. Leave me not, nor forsake me, O God of my salvation.

<sup>10</sup> When my father and my mother Have forsaken me, then doth Jehovah gather me.

<sup>11</sup> Shew me, O Jehovah, Thy way, And lead me in a path of uprightness, For the sake of my beholders.

<sup>12</sup> Give me not to the will of my adversaries, For risen against me have false witnesses, And they breathe out violence to me.

<sup>13</sup> I had not believed to look on the goodness of Jehovah In the land of the living!

<sup>14</sup> Look unto Jehovah — be strong, And He doth strengthen thy heart, Yea, look unto Jehovah!
