# Psalm 104 

**¹** Bless, O my soul, Jehovah! Jehovah, my God, Thou hast been very great, Honour and majesty Thou hast put on.

**²** Covering himself [with] light as a garment, Stretching out the heavens as a curtain,

**³** Who is laying the beam of His upper chambers in the waters, Who is making thick clouds His chariot, Who is walking on wings of wind,

**⁴** Making His messengers — the winds, His ministers — the flaming fire.

**⁵** He hath founded earth on its bases, It is not moved to the age and for ever.

**⁶** The abyss! as with clothing Thou hast covered it, Above hills do waters stand.

**⁷** From Thy rebuke they flee, From the voice of Thy thunder haste away.

**⁸** They go up hills — they go down valleys, Unto a place Thou hast founded for them.

**⁹** A border Thou hast set, they pass not over, They turn not back to cover the earth.

**¹⁰** Who is sending forth fountains in valleys, Between hills they go on.

**¹¹** They water every beast of the field, Wild asses break their thirst.

**¹²** By them the fowl of the heavens doth dwell, From between the branches They give forth the voice.

**¹³** Watering hills from His upper chambers, From the fruit of Thy works is the earth satisfied.

**¹⁴** Causing grass to spring up for cattle, And herb for the service of man, To bring forth bread from the earth,

**¹⁵** And wine — it rejoiceth the heart of man, To cause the face to shine from oil, And bread — the heart of man it supporteth.

**¹⁶** Satisfied [are] the trees of Jehovah, Cedars of Lebanon that He hath planted,

**¹⁷** Where birds do make nests, The stork — the firs [are] her house.

**¹⁸** The high hills [are] for wild goats, Rocks [are] a refuge for conies,

**¹⁹** He made the moon for seasons, The sun hath known his place of entrance.

**²⁰** Thou settest darkness, and it is night, In it doth every beast of the forest creep.

**²¹** The young lions are roaring for prey, And to seek from God their food.

**²²** The sun riseth, they are gathered, And in their dens they crouch.

**²³** Man goeth forth to his work, And to his service — till evening.

**²⁴** How many have been Thy works, O Jehovah, All of them in wisdom Thou hast made, Full is the earth of thy possessions.

**²⁵** This, the sea, great and broad of sides, There [are] moving things — innumerable, Living creatures — small with great.

**²⁶** There do ships go: leviathan, That Thou hast formed to play in it.

**²⁷** All of them unto Thee do look, To give their food in its season.

**²⁸** Thou dost give to them — they gather, Thou dost open Thy hand — they [are] satisfied [with] good.

**²⁹** Thou hidest Thy face — they are troubled, Thou gatherest their spirit — they expire, And unto their dust they turn back.

**³⁰** Thou sendest out Thy Spirit, they are created, And Thou renewest the face of the ground.

**³¹** The honour of Jehovah is to the age, Jehovah rejoiceth in His works,

**³²** Who is looking to earth, and it trembleth, He cometh against hills, and they smoke.

**³³** I sing to Jehovah during my life, I sing praise to my God while I exist.

**³⁴** Sweet is my meditation on Him, I — I do rejoice in Jehovah.

**³⁵** Consumed are sinners from the earth, And the wicked are no more. Bless, O my soul, Jehovah. Praise ye Jehovah!
