# Psalm 134

<sup>1</sup> A Song of the Ascents. Lo, bless Jehovah, all servants of Jehovah, Who are standing in the house of Jehovah by night.

<sup>2</sup> Lift up your hands [in] the sanctuary, And bless ye Jehovah.

<sup>3</sup> Jehovah doth bless thee out of Zion, The maker of the heavens and earth!
