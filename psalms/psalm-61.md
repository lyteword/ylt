# Psalm 61

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer, on stringed instruments. — By David. Hear, O God, my loud cry, attend to my prayer.

<sup>2</sup> From the end of the land unto Thee I call, In the feebleness of my heart, Into a rock higher than I Thou dost lead me.

<sup>3</sup> For Thou hast been a refuge for me, A tower of strength because of the enemy.

<sup>4</sup> I sojourn in Thy tent to the ages, I trust in the secret place of Thy wings. Selah.

<sup>5</sup> For Thou, O God, hast hearkened to my vows, Thou hast appointed the inheritance Of those fearing Thy name.

<sup>6</sup> Days to the days of the king Thou addest, His years as generation and generation.

<sup>7</sup> He dwelleth to the age before God, Kindness and truth appoint — they keep him.

<sup>8</sup> So do I praise Thy name for ever, When I pay my vows day by day!
