# Psalm 30

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm. — A song of the dedication of the house of David. I exalt Thee, O Jehovah, For Thou hast drawn me up, and hast not let mine enemies rejoice over me.

<sup>2</sup> Jehovah my God, I have cried to Thee, And Thou dost heal me.

<sup>3</sup> Jehovah, Thou hast brought up from Sheol my soul, Thou hast kept me alive, From going down [to] the pit.

<sup>4</sup> Sing praise to Jehovah, ye His saints, And give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness,

<sup>5</sup> For — a moment [is] in His anger, Life [is] in His good-will, At even remaineth weeping, and at morn singing.

<sup>6</sup> And I — I have said in mine ease, 'I am not moved — to the age.

<sup>7</sup> O Jehovah, in Thy good pleasure, Thou hast caused strength to remain for my mountain,' Thou hast hidden Thy face — I have been troubled.

<sup>8</sup> Unto Thee, O Jehovah, I call, And unto Jehovah I make supplication.

<sup>9</sup> 'What gain [is] in my blood? In my going down unto corruption? Doth dust thank Thee? doth it declare Thy truth?

<sup>10</sup> Hear, O Jehovah, and favour me, O Jehovah, be a helper to me.'

<sup>11</sup> Thou hast turned my mourning to dancing for me, Thou hast loosed my sackcloth, And girdest me [with] joy.

<sup>12</sup> So that honour doth praise Thee, and is not silent, O Jehovah, my God, to the age I thank Thee!
