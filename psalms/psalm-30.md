# Psalm 30 

**¹** A Psalm. — A song of the dedication of the house of David. I exalt Thee, O Jehovah, For Thou hast drawn me up, and hast not let mine enemies rejoice over me.

**²** Jehovah my God, I have cried to Thee, And Thou dost heal me.

**³** Jehovah, Thou hast brought up from Sheol my soul, Thou hast kept me alive, From going down [to] the pit.

**⁴** Sing praise to Jehovah, ye His saints, And give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness,

**⁵** For — a moment [is] in His anger, Life [is] in His good-will, At even remaineth weeping, and at morn singing.

**⁶** And I — I have said in mine ease, 'I am not moved — to the age.

**⁷** O Jehovah, in Thy good pleasure, Thou hast caused strength to remain for my mountain,' Thou hast hidden Thy face — I have been troubled.

**⁸** Unto Thee, O Jehovah, I call, And unto Jehovah I make supplication.

**⁹** 'What gain [is] in my blood? In my going down unto corruption? Doth dust thank Thee? doth it declare Thy truth?

**¹⁰** Hear, O Jehovah, and favour me, O Jehovah, be a helper to me.'

**¹¹** Thou hast turned my mourning to dancing for me, Thou hast loosed my sackcloth, And girdest me [with] joy.

**¹²** So that honour doth praise Thee, and is not silent, O Jehovah, my God, to the age I thank Thee!
