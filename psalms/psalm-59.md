# Psalm 59

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer. — 'Destroy not,' by David. — A secret treasure, in Saul's sending, and they watch the house to put him to death. Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God, From my withstanders set me on high.

<sup>2</sup> Deliver me from workers of iniquity, And from men of blood save me.

<sup>3</sup> For, lo, they laid wait for my soul, Assembled against me are strong ones, Not my transgression nor my sin, O Jehovah.

<sup>4</sup> Without punishment they run and prepare themselves, Stir up to meet me, and see.

<sup>5</sup> And Thou, Jehovah, God of Hosts, God of Israel, Awake to inspect all the nations. Favour not any treacherous dealers of iniquity. Selah.

<sup>6</sup> They turn back at evening, They make a noise like a dog, And go round about the city.

<sup>7</sup> Lo, they belch out with their mouths, Swords [are] in their lips, for 'Who heareth?'

<sup>8</sup> And Thou, O Jehovah dost laugh at them, Thou dost mock at all the nations.

<sup>9</sup> O my Strength, unto Thee I take heed, For God [is] my tower — the God of my kindness.

<sup>10</sup> God doth go before me, He causeth me to look on mine enemies.

<sup>11</sup> Slay them not, lest my people forget, Shake them by Thy strength, And bring them down, O Lord our shield.

<sup>12</sup> The sin of their mouth [is] a word of their lips, And they are captured in their pride, And from the curse and lying they recount.

<sup>13</sup> Consume in fury, consume and they are not, And they know that God is ruling in Jacob, To the ends of the earth. Selah.

<sup>14</sup> And they turn back at evening, They make a noise like a dog, And they go round about the city.

<sup>15</sup> They — they wander for food, If they are not satisfied — then they murmur.

<sup>16</sup> And I — I sing [of] Thy strength, And I sing at morn [of] Thy kindness, For thou hast been a tower to me, And a refuge for me in a day of adversity.

<sup>17</sup> O my Strength, unto Thee I sing praise, For God [is] my tower, the God of my kindness!
