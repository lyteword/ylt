# Psalm 138

<sup>1</sup> By David. I confess Thee, with all my heart, Before the gods I do praise Thee.

<sup>2</sup> I bow myself toward Thy holy temple, And I confess Thy name, For Thy kindness, and for Thy truth, For Thou hast made great Thy saying above all Thy name.

<sup>3</sup> In the day I called, when Thou dost answer me, Thou dost strengthen me in my soul [with] strength.

<sup>4</sup> O Jehovah, all kings of earth confess Thee, When they have heard the sayings of Thy mouth.

<sup>5</sup> And they sing in the ways of Jehovah, For great [is] the honour of Jehovah.

<sup>6</sup> For high [is] Jehovah, and the lowly He seeth, And the haughty from afar He knoweth.

<sup>7</sup> If I walk in the midst of distress Thou quickenest me, Against the anger of mine enemies Thou sendest forth Thy hand, And Thy right hand doth save me.

<sup>8</sup> Jehovah doth perfect for me, O Jehovah, Thy kindness [is] to the age, The works of Thy hands let not fall!
