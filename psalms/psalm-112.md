# Psalm 112

**¹** Praise ye Jah! O the happiness of one fearing Jehovah, In His commands he hath delighted greatly.

**²** Mighty in the earth is his seed, The generation of the upright is blessed.

**³** Wealth and riches [are] in his house, And his righteousness is standing for ever.

**⁴** Light hath risen in darkness to the upright, Gracious, and merciful, and righteous.

**⁵** Good [is] the man — gracious and lending, He sustaineth his matters in judgment.

**⁶** For — to the age he is not moved; For a memorial age-during is the righteous.

**⁷** Of an evil report he is not afraid, Prepared is His heart, confident in Jehovah.

**⁸** Sustained is his heart — he feareth not, Till that he look on his adversaries.

**⁹** He hath scattered — hath given to the needy, His righteousness is standing for ever, His horn is exalted with honour.

**¹⁰** The wicked seeth, and hath been angry, His teeth he gnasheth, and hath melted, The desire of the wicked doth perish!
