# Psalm 72 

**¹** By Solomon. O God, Thy judgments to the king give, And Thy righteousness to the king's son.

**²** He judgeth Thy people with righteousness, And Thy poor with judgment.

**³** The mountains bear peace to the people, And the heights by righteousness.

**⁴** He judgeth the poor of the people, Giveth deliverance to the sons of the needy, And bruiseth the oppressor.

**⁵** They fear Thee with the sun, and before the moon, Generation — generations.

**⁶** He cometh down as rain on mown grass, As showers — sprinkling the earth.

**⁷** Flourish in his days doth the righteous, And abundance of peace till the moon is not.

**⁸** And he ruleth from sea unto sea, And from the river unto the ends of earth.

**⁹** Before him bow do the inhabitants of the dry places, And his enemies lick the dust.

**¹⁰** Kings of Tarshish and of the isles send back a present. Kings of Sheba and Seba a reward bring near.

**¹¹** And all kings do bow themselves to him, All nations do serve him,

**¹²** For he delivereth the needy who crieth, And the poor when he hath no helper,

**¹³** He hath pity on the poor and needy, And the souls of the needy he saveth,

**¹⁴** From fraud and from violence he redeemeth their soul, And precious is their blood in his eyes.

**¹⁵** And he liveth, and giveth to him of the gold of Sheba, And prayeth for him continually, All the day he doth bless him.

**¹⁶** There is a handful of corn in the earth, On the top of mountains, Shake like Lebanon doth its fruit, And they flourish out of the city as the herb of the earth.

**¹⁷** His name is to the age, Before the sun is his name continued, And they bless themselves in him, All nations do pronounce him happy.

**¹⁸** Blessed is Jehovah God, God of Israel, He alone is doing wonders,

**¹⁹** And blessed [is] the Name of His honour to the age, And the whole earth is filled [with] His honour. Amen, and amen!

**²⁰** The prayers of David son of Jesse have been ended.
