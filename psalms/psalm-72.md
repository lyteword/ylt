# Psalm 72

<sup>1</sup> By Solomon. O God, Thy judgments to the king give, And Thy righteousness to the king's son.

<sup>2</sup> He judgeth Thy people with righteousness, And Thy poor with judgment.

<sup>3</sup> The mountains bear peace to the people, And the heights by righteousness.

<sup>4</sup> He judgeth the poor of the people, Giveth deliverance to the sons of the needy, And bruiseth the oppressor.

<sup>5</sup> They fear Thee with the sun, and before the moon, Generation — generations.

<sup>6</sup> He cometh down as rain on mown grass, As showers — sprinkling the earth.

<sup>7</sup> Flourish in his days doth the righteous, And abundance of peace till the moon is not.

<sup>8</sup> And he ruleth from sea unto sea, And from the river unto the ends of earth.

<sup>9</sup> Before him bow do the inhabitants of the dry places, And his enemies lick the dust.

<sup>10</sup> Kings of Tarshish and of the isles send back a present. Kings of Sheba and Seba a reward bring near.

<sup>11</sup> And all kings do bow themselves to him, All nations do serve him,

<sup>12</sup> For he delivereth the needy who crieth, And the poor when he hath no helper,

<sup>13</sup> He hath pity on the poor and needy, And the souls of the needy he saveth,

<sup>14</sup> From fraud and from violence he redeemeth their soul, And precious is their blood in his eyes.

<sup>15</sup> And he liveth, and giveth to him of the gold of Sheba, And prayeth for him continually, All the day he doth bless him.

<sup>16</sup> There is a handful of corn in the earth, On the top of mountains, Shake like Lebanon doth its fruit, And they flourish out of the city as the herb of the earth.

<sup>17</sup> His name is to the age, Before the sun is his name continued, And they bless themselves in him, All nations do pronounce him happy.

<sup>18</sup> Blessed is Jehovah God, God of Israel, He alone is doing wonders,

<sup>19</sup> And blessed [is] the Name of His honour to the age, And the whole earth is filled [with] His honour. Amen, and amen!

<sup>20</sup> The prayers of David son of Jesse have been ended.
