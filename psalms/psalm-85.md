# Psalm 85

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer. — By sons of Korah. A Psalm. Thou hast accepted, O Jehovah, Thy land, Thou hast turned [to] the captivity of Jacob.

<sup>2</sup> Thou hast borne away the iniquity of Thy people, Thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.

<sup>3</sup> Thou hast gathered up all Thy wrath, Thou hast turned back from the fierceness of Thine anger.

<sup>4</sup> Turn back [to] us, O God of our salvation, And make void Thine anger with us.

<sup>5</sup> To the age art Thou angry against us? Dost Thou draw out Thine anger To generation and generation?

<sup>6</sup> Dost Thou not turn back? Thou revivest us, And Thy people do rejoice in Thee.

<sup>7</sup> Show us, O Jehovah, thy kindness, And Thy salvation Thou dost give to us.

<sup>8</sup> I hear what God Jehovah speaketh, For He speaketh peace unto His people, And unto His saints, and they turn not back to folly.

<sup>9</sup> Only, near to those fearing Him [is] His salvation, That honour may dwell in our land.

<sup>10</sup> Kindness and truth have met, Righteousness and peace have kissed,

<sup>11</sup> Truth from the earth springeth up, And righteousness from heaven looketh out,

<sup>12</sup> Jehovah also giveth that which is good, And our land doth give its increase.

<sup>13</sup> Righteousness before Him goeth, And maketh His footsteps for a way!
