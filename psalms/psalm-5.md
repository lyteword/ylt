# Psalm 5 

**¹** To the Overseer, 'Concerning the Inheritances.' — A Psalm of David. My sayings hear, O Jehovah, Consider my meditation.

**²** Be attentive to the voice of my cry, My king and my God, For unto Thee I pray habitually.

**³** Jehovah, [at] morning Thou hearest my voice, [At] morning I set in array for Thee, And I look out.

**⁴** For not a God desiring wickedness [art] Thou, Evil inhabiteth Thee not.

**⁵** The boastful station not themselves before Thine eyes: Thou hast hated all working iniquity.

**⁶** Thou destroyest those speaking lies, A man of blood and deceit Jehovah doth abominate.

**⁷** And I, in the abundance of Thy kindness, I enter Thy house, I bow myself toward Thy holy temple in Thy fear.

**⁸** O Jehovah, lead me in Thy righteousness, Because of those observing me, Make straight before me Thy way,

**⁹** For there is no stability in their mouth. Their heart [is] mischiefs, An open grave [is] their throat, Their tongue they make smooth.

**¹⁰** Declare them guilty, O God, Let them fall from their own counsels, In the abundance of their transgressions Drive them away, Because they have rebelled against Thee.

**¹¹** And rejoice do all trusting in Thee, To the age they sing, and Thou coverest them over, And those loving Thy name exult in Thee.

**¹²** For Thou blessest the righteous, O Jehovah, As a buckler with favour dost compass him!
