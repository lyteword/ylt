# Psalm 105

<sup>1</sup> Give ye thanks to Jehovah — call ye in His name, Make known among the peoples His acts.

<sup>2</sup> Sing ye to Him — sing praise to Him, Meditate ye on all His wonders.

<sup>3</sup> Boast yourselves in His Holy Name, The heart of those seeking Jehovah rejoiceth.

<sup>4</sup> Seek ye Jehovah and His strength, Seek ye His face continually.

<sup>5</sup> Remember His wonders that He did, His signs and the judgments of His mouth.

<sup>6</sup> O seed of Abraham, His servant, O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones.

<sup>7</sup> He [is] Jehovah our God, In all the earth [are] His judgments.

<sup>8</sup> He hath remembered to the age His covenant, The word He commanded to a thousand generations,

<sup>9</sup> That He hath made with Abraham, And His oath to Isaac,

<sup>10</sup> And doth establish it to Jacob for a statute, To Israel — a covenant age-during,

<sup>11</sup> Saying, 'To thee I give the land of Canaan, The portion of your inheritance,'

<sup>12</sup> In their being few in number, But a few, and sojourners in it.

<sup>13</sup> And they go up and down, from nation unto nation, From a kingdom unto another people.

<sup>14</sup> He hath not suffered any to oppress them And He reproveth for their sakes kings.

<sup>15</sup> 'Strike not against Mine anointed, And to My prophets do not evil.'

<sup>16</sup> And He calleth a famine on the land, The whole staff of bread He hath broken.

<sup>17</sup> He hath sent before them a man, For a servant hath Joseph been sold.

<sup>18</sup> They have afflicted with fetters his feet, Iron hath entered his soul,

<sup>19</sup> Till the time of the coming of His word The saying of Jehovah hath tried him.

<sup>20</sup> The king hath sent, and looseth him, The ruler of the peoples, and draweth him out.

<sup>21</sup> He hath made him lord of his house, And ruler over all his possessions.

<sup>22</sup> To bind his chiefs at his pleasure, And his elders he maketh wise.

<sup>23</sup> And Israel cometh in to Egypt, And Jacob hath sojourned in the land of Ham.

<sup>24</sup> And He maketh His people very fruitful, And maketh it mightier than its adversaries.

<sup>25</sup> He turned their heart to hate His people, To conspire against His servants.

<sup>26</sup> He hath sent Moses His servant, Aaron whom He had fixed on.

<sup>27</sup> They have set among them the matters of His signs, And wonders in the land of Ham.

<sup>28</sup> He hath sent darkness, and it is dark, And they have not provoked His word.

<sup>29</sup> He hath turned their waters to blood, And putteth to death their fish.

<sup>30</sup> Teemed hath their land [with] frogs, In the inner chambers of their kings.

<sup>31</sup> He hath said, and the beetle cometh, Lice into all their border.

<sup>32</sup> He hath made their showers hail, A flaming fire [is] in their land.

<sup>33</sup> And He smiteth their vine and their fig, And shivereth the trees of their border.

<sup>34</sup> He hath said, and the locust cometh, And the cankerworm — innumerable,

<sup>35</sup> And it consumeth every herb in their land, And it consumeth the fruit of their ground.

<sup>36</sup> And He smiteth every first-born in their land, The first-fruit of all their strength,

<sup>37</sup> And bringeth them out with silver and gold, And there is not in its tribes a feeble one.

<sup>38</sup> Rejoiced hath Egypt in their going forth, For their fear had fallen upon them.

<sup>39</sup> He hath spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to enlighten the night.

<sup>40</sup> They have asked, and He bringeth quails, And [with] bread of heaven satisfieth them.

<sup>41</sup> He hath opened a rock, and waters issue, They have gone on in dry places — a river.

<sup>42</sup> For He hath remembered His holy word, With Abraham His servant,

<sup>43</sup> And He bringeth forth His people with joy, With singing His chosen ones.

<sup>44</sup> And He giveth to them the lands of nations, And the labour of peoples they possess,

<sup>45</sup> That they may observe His statutes, And His laws may keep. Praise ye Jehovah!
