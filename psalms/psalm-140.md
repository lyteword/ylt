# Psalm 140

**¹** To the Overseer. — A Psalm of David. Deliver me, O Jehovah, from an evil man, From one of violence Thou keepest me.

**²** Who have devised evils in the heart, All the day they assemble [for] wars.

**³** They sharpened their tongue as a serpent, Poison of an adder [is] under their lips. Selah.

**⁴** Preserve me, Jehovah, from the hands of the wicked, From one of violence Thou keepest me, Who have devised to overthrow my steps.

**⁵** The proud hid a snare for me — and cords, They spread a net by the side of the path, Snares they have set for me. Selah.

**⁶** I have said to Jehovah, 'My God [art] Thou, Hear, Jehovah, the voice of my supplications.'

**⁷** O Jehovah, my Lord, strength of my salvation, Thou hast covered my head in the day of armour.

**⁸** Grant not, O Jehovah, the desires of the wicked, His wicked device bring not forth, They are high. Selah.

**⁹** The chief of my surrounders, The perverseness of their lips covereth them.

**¹⁰** They cause to fall on themselves burning coals, Into fire He doth cast them, Into deep pits — they arise not.

**¹¹** A talkative man is not established in the earth, One of violence — evil hunteth to overflowing.

**¹²** I have known that Jehovah doth execute The judgment of the afflicted, The judgment of the needy.

**¹³** Only — the righteous give thanks to Thy name, The upright do dwell with Thy presence!
