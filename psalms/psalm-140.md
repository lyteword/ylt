# Psalm 140

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer. — A Psalm of David. Deliver me, O Jehovah, from an evil man, From one of violence Thou keepest me.

<sup>2</sup> Who have devised evils in the heart, All the day they assemble [for] wars.

<sup>3</sup> They sharpened their tongue as a serpent, Poison of an adder [is] under their lips. Selah.

<sup>4</sup> Preserve me, Jehovah, from the hands of the wicked, From one of violence Thou keepest me, Who have devised to overthrow my steps.

<sup>5</sup> The proud hid a snare for me — and cords, They spread a net by the side of the path, Snares they have set for me. Selah.

<sup>6</sup> I have said to Jehovah, 'My God [art] Thou, Hear, Jehovah, the voice of my supplications.'

<sup>7</sup> O Jehovah, my Lord, strength of my salvation, Thou hast covered my head in the day of armour.

<sup>8</sup> Grant not, O Jehovah, the desires of the wicked, His wicked device bring not forth, They are high. Selah.

<sup>9</sup> The chief of my surrounders, The perverseness of their lips covereth them.

<sup>10</sup> They cause to fall on themselves burning coals, Into fire He doth cast them, Into deep pits — they arise not.

<sup>11</sup> A talkative man is not established in the earth, One of violence — evil hunteth to overflowing.

<sup>12</sup> I have known that Jehovah doth execute The judgment of the afflicted, The judgment of the needy.

<sup>13</sup> Only — the righteous give thanks to Thy name, The upright do dwell with Thy presence!
