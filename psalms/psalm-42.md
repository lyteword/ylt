# Psalm 42

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer. — An Instruction. By sons of Korah. As a hart doth pant for streams of water, So my soul panteth toward Thee, O God.

<sup>2</sup> My soul thirsted for God, for the living God, When do I enter and see the face of God?

<sup>3</sup> My tear hath been to me bread day and night, In their saying unto me all the day, 'Where [is] thy God?'

<sup>4</sup> These I remember, and pour out my soul in me, For I pass over into the booth, I go softly with them unto the house of God, With the voice of singing and confession, The multitude keeping feast!

<sup>5</sup> What! bowest thou thyself, O my soul? Yea, art thou troubled within me? Wait for God, for still I confess Him: The salvation of my countenance — My God!

<sup>6</sup> In me doth my soul bow itself, Therefore I remember Thee from the land of Jordan, And of the Hermons, from the hill Mizar.

<sup>7</sup> Deep unto deep is calling At the noise of Thy water-spouts, All Thy breakers and Thy billows passed over me.

<sup>8</sup> By day Jehovah commandeth His kindness, And by night a song [is] with me, A prayer to the God of my life.

<sup>9</sup> I say to God my rock, 'Why hast Thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning in the oppression of an enemy?

<sup>10</sup> With a sword in my bones Have mine adversaries reproached me, In their saying unto me all the day, 'Where [is] thy God?'

<sup>11</sup> What! bowest thou thyself, O my soul? And what! art thou troubled within me? Wait for God, for still I confess Him, The salvation of my countenance, and my God!
