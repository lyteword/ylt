# Psalm 118

**¹** Give ye thanks to Jehovah, For good, for to the age [is] His kindness.

**²** I pray you, let Israel say, That, to the age [is] His kindness.

**³** I pray you, let the house of Aaron say, That, to the age [is] His kindness.

**⁴** I pray you, let those fearing Jehovah say, That, to the age [is] His kindness.

**⁵** From the straitness I called Jah, Jah answered me in a broad place.

**⁶** Jehovah [is] for me, I do not fear what man doth to me.

**⁷** Jehovah [is] for me among my helpers, And I — I look on those hating me.

**⁸** Better to take refuge in Jehovah than to trust in man,

**⁹** Better to take refuge in Jehovah, Than to trust in princes.

**¹⁰** All nations have compassed me about, In the name of Jehovah I surely cut them off.

**¹¹** They have compassed me about, Yea, they have compassed me about, In the name of Jehovah I surely cut them off.

**¹²** They compassed me about as bees, They have been extinguished as a fire of thorns, In the name of Jehovah I surely cut them off.

**¹³** Thou hast sorely thrust me to fall, And Jehovah hath helped me.

**¹⁴** My strength and song [is] Jah, And He is to me for salvation.

**¹⁵** A voice of singing and salvation, [Is] in the tents of the righteous, The right hand of Jehovah is doing valiantly.

**¹⁶** The right hand of Jehovah is exalted, The right hand of Jehovah is doing valiantly.

**¹⁷** I do not die, but live, And recount the works of Jah,

**¹⁸** Jah hath sorely chastened me, And to death hath not given me up.

**¹⁹** Open ye to me gates of righteousness, I enter into them — I thank Jah.

**²⁰** This [is] the gate to Jehovah, The righteous enter into it.

**²¹** I thank Thee, for Thou hast answered me, And art to me for salvation.

**²²** A stone the builders refused Hath become head of a corner.

**²³** From Jehovah hath this been, It [is] wonderful in our eyes,

**²⁴** This [is] the day Jehovah hath made, We rejoice and are glad in it.

**²⁵** I beseech Thee, O Jehovah, save, I pray Thee, I beseech Thee, O Jehovah, prosper, I pray Thee.

**²⁶** Blessed [is] he who is coming In the name of Jehovah, We blessed you from the house of Jehovah,

**²⁷** God [is] Jehovah, and He giveth to us light, Direct ye the festal-sacrifice with cords, Unto the horns of the altar.

**²⁸** My God Thou [art], and I confess Thee, My God, I exalt Thee.

**²⁹** Give ye thanks to Jehovah, For good, for to the age, [is] His kindness!
