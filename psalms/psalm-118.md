# Psalm 118

<sup>1</sup> Give ye thanks to Jehovah, For good, for to the age [is] His kindness.

<sup>2</sup> I pray you, let Israel say, That, to the age [is] His kindness.

<sup>3</sup> I pray you, let the house of Aaron say, That, to the age [is] His kindness.

<sup>4</sup> I pray you, let those fearing Jehovah say, That, to the age [is] His kindness.

<sup>5</sup> From the straitness I called Jah, Jah answered me in a broad place.

<sup>6</sup> Jehovah [is] for me, I do not fear what man doth to me.

<sup>7</sup> Jehovah [is] for me among my helpers, And I — I look on those hating me.

<sup>8</sup> Better to take refuge in Jehovah than to trust in man,

<sup>9</sup> Better to take refuge in Jehovah, Than to trust in princes.

<sup>10</sup> All nations have compassed me about, In the name of Jehovah I surely cut them off.

<sup>11</sup> They have compassed me about, Yea, they have compassed me about, In the name of Jehovah I surely cut them off.

<sup>12</sup> They compassed me about as bees, They have been extinguished as a fire of thorns, In the name of Jehovah I surely cut them off.

<sup>13</sup> Thou hast sorely thrust me to fall, And Jehovah hath helped me.

<sup>14</sup> My strength and song [is] Jah, And He is to me for salvation.

<sup>15</sup> A voice of singing and salvation, [Is] in the tents of the righteous, The right hand of Jehovah is doing valiantly.

<sup>16</sup> The right hand of Jehovah is exalted, The right hand of Jehovah is doing valiantly.

<sup>17</sup> I do not die, but live, And recount the works of Jah,

<sup>18</sup> Jah hath sorely chastened me, And to death hath not given me up.

<sup>19</sup> Open ye to me gates of righteousness, I enter into them — I thank Jah.

<sup>20</sup> This [is] the gate to Jehovah, The righteous enter into it.

<sup>21</sup> I thank Thee, for Thou hast answered me, And art to me for salvation.

<sup>22</sup> A stone the builders refused Hath become head of a corner.

<sup>23</sup> From Jehovah hath this been, It [is] wonderful in our eyes,

<sup>24</sup> This [is] the day Jehovah hath made, We rejoice and are glad in it.

<sup>25</sup> I beseech Thee, O Jehovah, save, I pray Thee, I beseech Thee, O Jehovah, prosper, I pray Thee.

<sup>26</sup> Blessed [is] he who is coming In the name of Jehovah, We blessed you from the house of Jehovah,

<sup>27</sup> God [is] Jehovah, and He giveth to us light, Direct ye the festal-sacrifice with cords, Unto the horns of the altar.

<sup>28</sup> My God Thou [art], and I confess Thee, My God, I exalt Thee.

<sup>29</sup> Give ye thanks to Jehovah, For good, for to the age, [is] His kindness!
