# Psalm 150

<sup>1</sup> Praise ye Jah! Praise ye God in His holy place, Praise Him in the expanse of His strength.

<sup>2</sup> Praise Him in His mighty acts, Praise Him according to the abundance of His greatness.

<sup>3</sup> Praise Him with blowing of trumpet, Praise Him with psaltery and harp.

<sup>4</sup> Praise Him with timbrel and dance, Praise Him with stringed instruments and organ.

<sup>5</sup> Praise Him with cymbals of sounding, Praise Him with cymbals of shouting.

<sup>6</sup> All that doth breathe doth praise Jah! Praise ye Jah!
