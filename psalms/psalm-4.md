# Psalm 4

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer with Stringed Instruments. — A Psalm of David. In my calling answer Thou me, O God of my righteousness. In adversity Thou gavest enlargement to me; Favour me, and hear my prayer.

<sup>2</sup> Sons of men! till when [is] my glory for shame? Ye love a vain thing, ye seek a lie. Selah.

<sup>3</sup> And know ye that Jehovah Hath separated a saintly one to Himself. Jehovah heareth in my calling to Him.

<sup>4</sup> 'Tremble ye, and do not sin;' Say ye [thus] in your heart on your bed, And be ye silent. Selah.

<sup>5</sup> Sacrifice ye sacrifices of righteousness, And trust ye unto Jehovah.

<sup>6</sup> Many are saying, 'Who doth show us good?' Lift on us the light of Thy face, O Jehovah,

<sup>7</sup> Thou hast given joy in my heart, From the time their corn and their wine Have been multiplied.

<sup>8</sup> In peace together I lie down and sleep, For Thou, O Jehovah, alone, In confidence dost cause me to dwell!
