# Psalm 4 

**¹** To the Overseer with Stringed Instruments. — A Psalm of David. In my calling answer Thou me, O God of my righteousness. In adversity Thou gavest enlargement to me; Favour me, and hear my prayer.

**²** Sons of men! till when [is] my glory for shame? Ye love a vain thing, ye seek a lie. Selah.

**³** And know ye that Jehovah Hath separated a saintly one to Himself. Jehovah heareth in my calling to Him.

**⁴** 'Tremble ye, and do not sin;' Say ye [thus] in your heart on your bed, And be ye silent. Selah.

**⁵** Sacrifice ye sacrifices of righteousness, And trust ye unto Jehovah.

**⁶** Many are saying, 'Who doth show us good?' Lift on us the light of Thy face, O Jehovah,

**⁷** Thou hast given joy in my heart, From the time their corn and their wine Have been multiplied.

**⁸** In peace together I lie down and sleep, For Thou, O Jehovah, alone, In confidence dost cause me to dwell!
