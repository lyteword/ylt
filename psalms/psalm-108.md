# Psalm 108

**¹** A Song, a Psalm of David. Prepared is my heart, O God, I sing, yea, I sing praise, also my honour.

**²** Awake, psaltery and harp, I awake the dawn.

**³** I thank Thee among peoples, O Jehovah, And I praise Thee among the nations.

**⁴** For great above the heavens [is] Thy kindness, And unto the clouds Thy truth.

**⁵** Be Thou exalted above the heavens, O God, And above all the earth Thy honour.

**⁶** That Thy beloved ones may be delivered, Save [with] Thy right hand, and answer us.

**⁷** God hath spoken in His holiness: I exult, I apportion Shechem, And the valley of Succoth I measure,

**⁸** Mine [is] Gilead, mine [is] Manasseh, And Ephraim [is] the strength of my head, Judah [is] my lawgiver,

**⁹** Moab [is] a pot for my washing, Upon Edom I cast my shoe, Over Philistia I shout habitually.

**¹⁰** Who doth bring me in to the fenced city? Who hath led me unto Edom?

**¹¹** Hast not Thou, O God, cast us off? And Thou goest not out, O God, with our hosts!

**¹²** Give to us help from adversity, And vain is the salvation of man.

**¹³** In God we do mightily, And He doth tread down our adversaries!
