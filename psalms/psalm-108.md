# Psalm 108

<sup>1</sup> A Song, a Psalm of David. Prepared is my heart, O God, I sing, yea, I sing praise, also my honour.

<sup>2</sup> Awake, psaltery and harp, I awake the dawn.

<sup>3</sup> I thank Thee among peoples, O Jehovah, And I praise Thee among the nations.

<sup>4</sup> For great above the heavens [is] Thy kindness, And unto the clouds Thy truth.

<sup>5</sup> Be Thou exalted above the heavens, O God, And above all the earth Thy honour.

<sup>6</sup> That Thy beloved ones may be delivered, Save [with] Thy right hand, and answer us.

<sup>7</sup> God hath spoken in His holiness: I exult, I apportion Shechem, And the valley of Succoth I measure,

<sup>8</sup> Mine [is] Gilead, mine [is] Manasseh, And Ephraim [is] the strength of my head, Judah [is] my lawgiver,

<sup>9</sup> Moab [is] a pot for my washing, Upon Edom I cast my shoe, Over Philistia I shout habitually.

<sup>10</sup> Who doth bring me in to the fenced city? Who hath led me unto Edom?

<sup>11</sup> Hast not Thou, O God, cast us off? And Thou goest not out, O God, with our hosts!

<sup>12</sup> Give to us help from adversity, And vain is the salvation of man.

<sup>13</sup> In God we do mightily, And He doth tread down our adversaries!
