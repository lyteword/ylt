# Psalm 135 

**¹** Praise ye Jah! Praise ye the name of Jehovah, Praise, ye servants of Jehovah,

**²** Who are standing in the house of Jehovah, In the courts of the house of our God.

**³** Praise ye Jah! for Jehovah [is] good, Sing praise to His name, for [it is] pleasant.

**⁴** For Jacob hath Jah chosen for Himself, Israel for His peculiar treasure.

**⁵** For I have known that great [is] Jehovah, Yea, our Lord [is] above all gods.

**⁶** All that Jehovah pleased He hath done, In the heavens and in earth, In the seas and all deep places,

**⁷** Causing vapours to ascend from the end of the earth, Lightnings for the rain He hath made, Bringing forth wind from His treasures.

**⁸** Who smote the first-born of Egypt, From man unto beast.

**⁹** He sent tokens and wonders into thy midst, O Egypt, On Pharaoh and on all his servants.

**¹⁰** Who smote many nations, and slew strong kings,

**¹¹** Even Sihon king of the Amorite, And Og king of Bashan, And all kingdoms of Canaan.

**¹²** And He gave their land an inheritance, An inheritance to Israel His people,

**¹³** O Jehovah, Thy name [is] to the age, O Jehovah, Thy memorial to all generations.

**¹⁴** For Jehovah doth judge His people, And for His servants comforteth Himself.

**¹⁵** The idols of the nations [are] silver and gold, Work of the hands of man.

**¹⁶** A mouth they have, and they speak not, Eyes they have, and they see not,

**¹⁷** Ears they have, and they give not ear, Nose — there is no breath in their mouth!

**¹⁸** Like them are their makers, Every one who is trusting in them.

**¹⁹** O house of Israel, bless ye Jehovah, O house of Aaron, bless ye Jehovah,

**²⁰** O house of Levi, bless ye Jehovah, Those fearing Jehovah, bless ye Jehovah.

**²¹** Blessed [is] Jehovah from Zion, Inhabiting Jerusalem — praise ye Jah!
