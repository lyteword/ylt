# Psalm 135

<sup>1</sup> Praise ye Jah! Praise ye the name of Jehovah, Praise, ye servants of Jehovah,

<sup>2</sup> Who are standing in the house of Jehovah, In the courts of the house of our God.

<sup>3</sup> Praise ye Jah! for Jehovah [is] good, Sing praise to His name, for [it is] pleasant.

<sup>4</sup> For Jacob hath Jah chosen for Himself, Israel for His peculiar treasure.

<sup>5</sup> For I have known that great [is] Jehovah, Yea, our Lord [is] above all gods.

<sup>6</sup> All that Jehovah pleased He hath done, In the heavens and in earth, In the seas and all deep places,

<sup>7</sup> Causing vapours to ascend from the end of the earth, Lightnings for the rain He hath made, Bringing forth wind from His treasures.

<sup>8</sup> Who smote the first-born of Egypt, From man unto beast.

<sup>9</sup> He sent tokens and wonders into thy midst, O Egypt, On Pharaoh and on all his servants.

<sup>10</sup> Who smote many nations, and slew strong kings,

<sup>11</sup> Even Sihon king of the Amorite, And Og king of Bashan, And all kingdoms of Canaan.

<sup>12</sup> And He gave their land an inheritance, An inheritance to Israel His people,

<sup>13</sup> O Jehovah, Thy name [is] to the age, O Jehovah, Thy memorial to all generations.

<sup>14</sup> For Jehovah doth judge His people, And for His servants comforteth Himself.

<sup>15</sup> The idols of the nations [are] silver and gold, Work of the hands of man.

<sup>16</sup> A mouth they have, and they speak not, Eyes they have, and they see not,

<sup>17</sup> Ears they have, and they give not ear, Nose — there is no breath in their mouth!

<sup>18</sup> Like them are their makers, Every one who is trusting in them.

<sup>19</sup> O house of Israel, bless ye Jehovah, O house of Aaron, bless ye Jehovah,

<sup>20</sup> O house of Levi, bless ye Jehovah, Those fearing Jehovah, bless ye Jehovah.

<sup>21</sup> Blessed [is] Jehovah from Zion, Inhabiting Jerusalem — praise ye Jah!
