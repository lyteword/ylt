# Psalm 128

**¹** A Song of the Ascents. O the happiness of every one fearing Jehovah, Who is walking in His ways.

**²** The labour of thy hands thou surely eatest, Happy [art] thou, and good [is] to thee.

**³** Thy wife [is] as a fruitful vine in the sides of thy house, Thy sons as olive plants around thy table.

**⁴** Lo, surely thus is the man blessed who is fearing Jehovah.

**⁵** Jehovah doth bless thee out of Zion, Look, then, on the good of Jerusalem, All the days of thy life,

**⁶** And see the sons of thy sons! Peace on Israel!
