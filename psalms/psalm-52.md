# Psalm 52

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer. — An instruction, by David, in the coming in of Doeg the Edomite, and he declareth to Saul, and saith to him, 'David came in unto the house of Ahimelech.' What, boasteth thou in evil, O mighty one? The kindness of God [is] all the day.

<sup>2</sup> Mischiefs doth thy tongue devise, Like a sharp razor, working deceit.

<sup>3</sup> Thou hast loved evil rather than good, Lying, than speaking righteousness. Selah.

<sup>4</sup> Thou hast loved all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.

<sup>5</sup> Also — God doth break thee down for ever, Taketh thee, and pulleth thee out of the tent, And He hath uprooted thee Out of the land of the living. Selah.

<sup>6</sup> And the righteous see, And fear, and laugh at him.

<sup>7</sup> 'Lo, the man who maketh not God his strong place, And trusteth in the abundance of his riches, He is strong in his mischiefs.'

<sup>8</sup> And I, as a green olive in the house of God, I have trusted in the kindness of God, To the age and for ever,

<sup>9</sup> I thank Thee to the age, because Thou hast done [it], And I wait [on] Thy name for [it is] good before Thy saints!
