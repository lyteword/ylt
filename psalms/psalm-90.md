# Psalm 90 

**¹** A Prayer of Moses, the man of God. Lord, a habitation Thou — Thou hast been, To us — in generation and generation,

**²** Before mountains were brought forth, And Thou dost form the earth and the world, Even from age unto age Thou [art] God.

**³** Thou turnest man unto a bruised thing, And sayest, Turn back, ye sons of men.

**⁴** For a thousand years in Thine eyes [are] as yesterday, For it passeth on, yea, a watch by night.

**⁵** Thou hast inundated them, they are asleep, In the morning as grass he changeth.

**⁶** In the morning it flourisheth, and hath changed, At evening it is cut down, and hath withered.

**⁷** For we were consumed in Thine anger, And in Thy fury we have been troubled.

**⁸** Thou hast set our iniquities before Thee, Our hidden things at the light of Thy face,

**⁹** For all our days pined away in Thy wrath, We consumed our years as a meditation.

**¹⁰** Days of our years, in them [are] seventy years, And if, by reason of might, eighty years, Yet [is] their enlargement labour and vanity, For it hath been cut off hastily, and we fly away.

**¹¹** Who knoweth the power of Thine anger? And according to Thy fear — Thy wrath?

**¹²** To number our days aright let [us] know, And we bring the heart to wisdom.

**¹³** Turn back, O Jehovah, till when? And repent concerning Thy servants.

**¹⁴** Satisfy us at morn [with] Thy kindness, And we sing and rejoice all our days.

**¹⁵** Cause us to rejoice according to the days Wherein Thou hast afflicted us, The years we have seen evil.

**¹⁶** Let Thy work appear unto Thy servants, And Thine honour on their sons.

**¹⁷** And let the pleasantness of Jehovah our God be upon us, And the work of our hands establish on us, Yea, the work of our hands establish it!
