# Psalm 90

<sup>1</sup> A Prayer of Moses, the man of God. Lord, a habitation Thou — Thou hast been, To us — in generation and generation,

<sup>2</sup> Before mountains were brought forth, And Thou dost form the earth and the world, Even from age unto age Thou [art] God.

<sup>3</sup> Thou turnest man unto a bruised thing, And sayest, Turn back, ye sons of men.

<sup>4</sup> For a thousand years in Thine eyes [are] as yesterday, For it passeth on, yea, a watch by night.

<sup>5</sup> Thou hast inundated them, they are asleep, In the morning as grass he changeth.

<sup>6</sup> In the morning it flourisheth, and hath changed, At evening it is cut down, and hath withered.

<sup>7</sup> For we were consumed in Thine anger, And in Thy fury we have been troubled.

<sup>8</sup> Thou hast set our iniquities before Thee, Our hidden things at the light of Thy face,

<sup>9</sup> For all our days pined away in Thy wrath, We consumed our years as a meditation.

<sup>10</sup> Days of our years, in them [are] seventy years, And if, by reason of might, eighty years, Yet [is] their enlargement labour and vanity, For it hath been cut off hastily, and we fly away.

<sup>11</sup> Who knoweth the power of Thine anger? And according to Thy fear — Thy wrath?

<sup>12</sup> To number our days aright let [us] know, And we bring the heart to wisdom.

<sup>13</sup> Turn back, O Jehovah, till when? And repent concerning Thy servants.

<sup>14</sup> Satisfy us at morn [with] Thy kindness, And we sing and rejoice all our days.

<sup>15</sup> Cause us to rejoice according to the days Wherein Thou hast afflicted us, The years we have seen evil.

<sup>16</sup> Let Thy work appear unto Thy servants, And Thine honour on their sons.

<sup>17</sup> And let the pleasantness of Jehovah our God be upon us, And the work of our hands establish on us, Yea, the work of our hands establish it!
