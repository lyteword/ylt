# Psalm 67

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer, with stringed instruments. — A Psalm, a Song. God doth favour us and bless us, Doth cause His face to shine with us. Selah.

<sup>2</sup> For the knowledge in earth of Thy way, among all nations of Thy salvation.

<sup>3</sup> Praise Thee do peoples, O God, Praise Thee do peoples, all of them.

<sup>4</sup> Rejoice and sing do nations, For Thou judgest peoples uprightly, And peoples on earth comfortest. Selah.

<sup>5</sup> Confess Thee do peoples, O God, Confess Thee do peoples — all of them.

<sup>6</sup> Earth hath given her increase, God doth bless us — our God,

<sup>7</sup> God doth bless us, and all ends of earth fear Him!
