# Psalm 47 

**¹** To the Overseer. — By sons of Korah. A Psalm. All ye peoples, clap the hand, Shout to God with a voice of singing,

**²** For Jehovah Most High [is] fearful, A great king over all the earth.

**³** He leadeth peoples under us, and nations under our feet.

**⁴** He doth choose for us our inheritance, The excellency of Jacob that He loves. Selah.

**⁵** God hath gone up with a shout, Jehovah with the sound of a trumpet.

**⁶** Praise God — praise — give praise to our king, praise.

**⁷** For king of all the earth [is] God, Give praise, O understanding one.

**⁸** God hath reigned over nations, God hath sat on His holy throne,

**⁹** Nobles of peoples have been gathered, [With] the people of the God of Abraham, For to God [are] the shields of earth, Greatly hath He been exalted!
