# Psalm 47

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer. — By sons of Korah. A Psalm. All ye peoples, clap the hand, Shout to God with a voice of singing,

<sup>2</sup> For Jehovah Most High [is] fearful, A great king over all the earth.

<sup>3</sup> He leadeth peoples under us, and nations under our feet.

<sup>4</sup> He doth choose for us our inheritance, The excellency of Jacob that He loves. Selah.

<sup>5</sup> God hath gone up with a shout, Jehovah with the sound of a trumpet.

<sup>6</sup> Praise God — praise — give praise to our king, praise.

<sup>7</sup> For king of all the earth [is] God, Give praise, O understanding one.

<sup>8</sup> God hath reigned over nations, God hath sat on His holy throne,

<sup>9</sup> Nobles of peoples have been gathered, [With] the people of the God of Abraham, For to God [are] the shields of earth, Greatly hath He been exalted!
