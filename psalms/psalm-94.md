# Psalm 94

**¹** God of vengeance — Jehovah! God of vengeance, shine forth.

**²** Be lifted up, O Judge of the earth, Send back a recompence on the proud.

**³** Till when [do] the wicked, O Jehovah? Till when do the wicked exult?

**⁴** They utter — they speak an old saw, All working iniquity do boast themselves.

**⁵** Thy people, O Jehovah, they bruise, And Thine inheritance they afflict.

**⁶** Widow and sojourner they slay, And fatherless ones they murder.

**⁷** And they say, 'Jehovah doth not see, And the God of Jacob doth not consider.'

**⁸** Consider, ye brutish among the people, And ye foolish, when do ye act wisely?

**⁹** He who planteth the ear doth He not hear? He who formeth the eye doth He not see?

**¹⁰** He who is instructing nations, Doth He not reprove? He who is teaching man knowledge [is] Jehovah.

**¹¹** He knoweth the thoughts of man, that they [are] vanity.

**¹²** O the happiness of the man Whom Thou instructest, O Jah, And out of Thy law teachest him,

**¹³** To give rest to him from days of evil, While a pit is digged for the wicked.

**¹⁴** For Jehovah leaveth not His people, And His inheritance forsaketh not.

**¹⁵** For to righteousness judgment turneth back, And after it all the upright of heart,

**¹⁶** Who riseth up for me with evil doers? Who stationeth himself for me with workers of iniquity?

**¹⁷** Unless Jehovah [were] a help to me, My soul had almost inhabited silence.

**¹⁸** If I have said, 'My foot hath slipped,' Thy kindness, O Jehovah, supporteth me.

**¹⁹** In the abundance of my thoughts within me, Thy comforts delight my soul.

**²⁰** Is a throne of mischief joined [with] Thee? A framer of perverseness by statute?

**²¹** They decree against the soul of the righteous, And innocent blood declare wicked.

**²²** And Jehovah is for a high place to me, And my God [is] for a rock — my refuge,

**²³** And turneth back on them their iniquity, And in their wickedness cutteth them off; Jehovah our God doth cut them off!
