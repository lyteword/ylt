# Psalm 94

<sup>1</sup> God of vengeance — Jehovah! God of vengeance, shine forth.

<sup>2</sup> Be lifted up, O Judge of the earth, Send back a recompence on the proud.

<sup>3</sup> Till when [do] the wicked, O Jehovah? Till when do the wicked exult?

<sup>4</sup> They utter — they speak an old saw, All working iniquity do boast themselves.

<sup>5</sup> Thy people, O Jehovah, they bruise, And Thine inheritance they afflict.

<sup>6</sup> Widow and sojourner they slay, And fatherless ones they murder.

<sup>7</sup> And they say, 'Jehovah doth not see, And the God of Jacob doth not consider.'

<sup>8</sup> Consider, ye brutish among the people, And ye foolish, when do ye act wisely?

<sup>9</sup> He who planteth the ear doth He not hear? He who formeth the eye doth He not see?

<sup>10</sup> He who is instructing nations, Doth He not reprove? He who is teaching man knowledge [is] Jehovah.

<sup>11</sup> He knoweth the thoughts of man, that they [are] vanity.

<sup>12</sup> O the happiness of the man Whom Thou instructest, O Jah, And out of Thy law teachest him,

<sup>13</sup> To give rest to him from days of evil, While a pit is digged for the wicked.

<sup>14</sup> For Jehovah leaveth not His people, And His inheritance forsaketh not.

<sup>15</sup> For to righteousness judgment turneth back, And after it all the upright of heart,

<sup>16</sup> Who riseth up for me with evil doers? Who stationeth himself for me with workers of iniquity?

<sup>17</sup> Unless Jehovah [were] a help to me, My soul had almost inhabited silence.

<sup>18</sup> If I have said, 'My foot hath slipped,' Thy kindness, O Jehovah, supporteth me.

<sup>19</sup> In the abundance of my thoughts within me, Thy comforts delight my soul.

<sup>20</sup> Is a throne of mischief joined [with] Thee? A framer of perverseness by statute?

<sup>21</sup> They decree against the soul of the righteous, And innocent blood declare wicked.

<sup>22</sup> And Jehovah is for a high place to me, And my God [is] for a rock — my refuge,

<sup>23</sup> And turneth back on them their iniquity, And in their wickedness cutteth them off; Jehovah our God doth cut them off!
