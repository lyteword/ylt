# Psalm 48 

**¹** A Song, a Psalm, by sons of Korah. Great [is] Jehovah, and praised greatly, In the city of our God — His holy hill.

**²** Beautiful [for] elevation, A joy of all the land, [is] Mount Zion, The sides of the north, the city of a great king.

**³** God in her high places is known for a tower.

**⁴** For, lo, the kings met, they passed by together,

**⁵** They have seen — so they have marvelled, They have been troubled, they were hastened away.

**⁶** Trembling hath seized them there, Pain, as of a travailing woman.

**⁷** By an east wind Thou shiverest ships of Tarshish.

**⁸** As we have heard, so we have seen, In the city of Jehovah of hosts, In the city of our God, God doth establish her — to the age. Selah.

**⁹** We have thought, O God, of Thy kindness, In the midst of Thy temple,

**¹⁰** As [is] Thy name, O God, so [is] Thy praise, Over the ends of the earth, Righteousness hath filled Thy right hand.

**¹¹** Rejoice doth Mount Zion, The daughters of Judah are joyful, For the sake of Thy judgments.

**¹²** Compass Zion, and go round her, count her towers,

**¹³** Set your heart to her bulwark, Consider her high places, So that ye recount to a later generation,

**¹⁴** That this God [is] our God — To the age and for ever, He — he doth lead us over death!
