# Psalm 144

<sup>1</sup> By David. Blessed [is] Jehovah my rock, who is teaching My hands for war, my fingers for battle.

<sup>2</sup> My kind one, and my bulwark, My tower, and my deliverer, My shield, and in whom I have trusted, Who is subduing my people under me!

<sup>3</sup> Jehovah, what [is] man that Thou knowest him? Son of man, that Thou esteemest him?

<sup>4</sup> Man to vanity hath been like, His days [are] as a shadow passing by.

<sup>5</sup> Jehovah, incline Thy heavens and come down, Strike against mountains, and they smoke.

<sup>6</sup> Send forth lightning, and scatter them, Send forth Thine arrows, and trouble them,

<sup>7</sup> Send forth Thy hand from on high, Free me, and deliver me from many waters, From the hand of sons of a stranger,

<sup>8</sup> Because their mouth hath spoken vanity, And their right hand [is] a right hand of falsehood.

<sup>9</sup> O God, a new song I sing to Thee, On a psaltery of ten strings I sing praise to Thee.

<sup>10</sup> Who is giving deliverance to kings, Who is freeing David His servant from the sword of evil.

<sup>11</sup> Free me, and deliver me From the hand of sons of a stranger, Because their mouth hath spoken vanity, And their right hand [is] a right hand of falsehood,

<sup>12</sup> Because our sons [are] as plants, Becoming great in their youth, Our daughters as hewn stones, Polished — the likeness of a palace,

<sup>13</sup> Our garners [are] full, bringing out from kind to kind, Our flocks are bringing forth thousands, Ten thousands in our out-places,

<sup>14</sup> Our oxen are carrying, there is no breach, And there is no outgoing, And there is no crying in our broad places.

<sup>15</sup> O the happiness of the people that is thus, O the happiness of the people whose God [is] Jehovah!
