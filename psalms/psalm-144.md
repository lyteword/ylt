# Psalm 144

**¹** By David. Blessed [is] Jehovah my rock, who is teaching My hands for war, my fingers for battle.

**²** My kind one, and my bulwark, My tower, and my deliverer, My shield, and in whom I have trusted, Who is subduing my people under me!

**³** Jehovah, what [is] man that Thou knowest him? Son of man, that Thou esteemest him?

**⁴** Man to vanity hath been like, His days [are] as a shadow passing by.

**⁵** Jehovah, incline Thy heavens and come down, Strike against mountains, and they smoke.

**⁶** Send forth lightning, and scatter them, Send forth Thine arrows, and trouble them,

**⁷** Send forth Thy hand from on high, Free me, and deliver me from many waters, From the hand of sons of a stranger,

**⁸** Because their mouth hath spoken vanity, And their right hand [is] a right hand of falsehood.

**⁹** O God, a new song I sing to Thee, On a psaltery of ten strings I sing praise to Thee.

**¹⁰** Who is giving deliverance to kings, Who is freeing David His servant from the sword of evil.

**¹¹** Free me, and deliver me From the hand of sons of a stranger, Because their mouth hath spoken vanity, And their right hand [is] a right hand of falsehood,

**¹²** Because our sons [are] as plants, Becoming great in their youth, Our daughters as hewn stones, Polished — the likeness of a palace,

**¹³** Our garners [are] full, bringing out from kind to kind, Our flocks are bringing forth thousands, Ten thousands in our out-places,

**¹⁴** Our oxen are carrying, there is no breach, And there is no outgoing, And there is no crying in our broad places.

**¹⁵** O the happiness of the people that is thus, O the happiness of the people whose God [is] Jehovah!
