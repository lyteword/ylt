# Psalm 147

**¹** Praise ye Jah! For [it is] good to praise our God, For pleasant — comely [is] praise.

**²** Building Jerusalem [is] Jehovah, The driven away of Israel He gathereth.

**³** Who is giving healing to the broken of heart, And is binding up their griefs.

**⁴** Appointing the number of the stars, To all them He giveth names.

**⁵** Great [is] our Lord, and abundant in power, Of His understanding there is no narration.

**⁶** Jehovah is causing the meek to stand, Making low the wicked unto the earth.

**⁷** Answer ye to Jehovah with thanksgiving, Sing ye to our God with a harp.

**⁸** Who is covering the heavens with clouds, Who is preparing for the earth rain, Who is causing grass to spring up [on] mountains,

**⁹** Giving to the beast its food, To the young of the ravens that call.

**¹⁰** Not in the might of the horse doth He delight, Not in the legs of a man is He pleased.

**¹¹** Jehovah is pleased with those fearing Him, With those waiting for His kindness.

**¹²** Glorify, O Jerusalem, Jehovah, Praise thy God, O Zion.

**¹³** For He did strengthen the bars of thy gates, He hath blessed thy sons in thy midst.

**¹⁴** Who is making thy border peace, [With] the fat of wheat He satisfieth Thee.

**¹⁵** Who is sending forth His saying [on] earth, Very speedily doth His word run.

**¹⁶** Who is giving snow like wool, Hoar-frost as ashes He scattereth.

**¹⁷** Casting forth His ice like morsels, Before His cold who doth stand?

**¹⁸** He sendeth forth His word and melteth them, He causeth His wind to blow — the waters flow.

**¹⁹** Declaring His words to Jacob, His statutes and His judgments to Israel.

**²⁰** He hath not done so to any nation, As to judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye Jah!
