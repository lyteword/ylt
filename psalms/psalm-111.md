# Psalm 111

<sup>1</sup> Praise ye Jah! I thank Jehovah with the whole heart, In the secret meeting of the upright, And of the company.

<sup>2</sup> Great [are] the works of Jehovah, Sought out by all desiring them.

<sup>3</sup> Honourable and majestic is His work, And His righteousness is standing for ever.

<sup>4</sup> A memorial He hath made of His wonders, Gracious and merciful [is] Jehovah.

<sup>5</sup> Prey He hath given to those fearing Him, He remembereth to the age His covenant.

<sup>6</sup> The power of His works He hath declared to His people, To give to them the inheritance of nations.

<sup>7</sup> The works of His hands [are] true and just, Stedfast [are] all His appointments.

<sup>8</sup> They are sustained for ever to the age. They are made in truth and uprightness.

<sup>9</sup> Redemption He hath sent to His people, He hath appointed to the age His covenant, Holy and fearful [is] His name.

<sup>10</sup> The beginning of wisdom [is] fear of Jehovah, Good understanding have all doing them, His praise [is] standing for ever!
