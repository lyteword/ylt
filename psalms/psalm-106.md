# Psalm 106

**¹** Praise ye Jah, give thanks to Jehovah, For good, for to the age, [is] His kindness.

**²** Who doth utter the mighty acts of Jehovah? Soundeth all His praise?

**³** O the happiness of those keeping judgment, Doing righteousness at all times.

**⁴** Remember me, O Jehovah, With the favour of Thy people, Look after me in Thy salvation.

**⁵** To look on the good of Thy chosen ones, To rejoice in the joy of Thy nation, To boast myself with Thine inheritance.

**⁶** We have sinned with our fathers, We have done perversely, we have done wickedly.

**⁷** Our fathers in Egypt, Have not considered wisely Thy wonders, They have not remembered The abundance of Thy kind acts, And provoke by the sea, at the sea of Suph.

**⁸** And He saveth them for His name's sake, To make known His might,

**⁹** And rebuketh the sea of Suph, and it is dried up, And causeth them to go Through depths as a wilderness.

**¹⁰** And He saveth them from the hand Of him who is hating, And redeemeth them from the hand of the enemy.

**¹¹** And waters cover their adversaries, One of them hath not been left.

**¹²** And they believe in His words, they sing His praise,

**¹³** They have hasted — forgotten His works, They have not waited for His counsel.

**¹⁴** And they lust greatly in a wilderness, And try God in a desert.

**¹⁵** And He giveth to them their request, And sendeth leanness into their soul.

**¹⁶** And they are envious of Moses in the camp, Of Aaron, Jehovah's holy one.

**¹⁷** Earth openeth, and swalloweth up Dathan, And covereth over the company of Abiram.

**¹⁸** And fire burneth among their company, A flame setteth on fire the wicked.

**¹⁹** They make a calf in Horeb, And bow themselves to a molten image,

**²⁰** And change their Honour Into the form of an ox eating herbs.

**²¹** They have forgotten God their saviour, The doer of great things in Egypt,

**²²** Of wonderful things in the land of Ham, Of fearful things by the sea of Suph.

**²³** And He saith to destroy them, Unless Moses, His chosen one, Had stood in the breach before Him, To turn back His wrath from destroying.

**²⁴** And they kick against the desirable land, They have not given credence to His word.

**²⁵** And they murmur in their tents, They have not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah.

**²⁶** And He lifteth up His hand to them, To cause them to fall in a wilderness,

**²⁷** And to cause their seed to fall among nations, And to scatter them through lands.

**²⁸** And they are coupled to Baal-Peor, And eat the sacrifices of the dead,

**²⁹** And they provoke to anger by their actions, And a plague breaketh forth upon them,

**³⁰** And Phinehas standeth, and executeth judgment, And the plague is restrained,

**³¹** And it is reckoned to him to righteousness, To all generations — unto the age.

**³²** And they cause wrath by the waters of Meribah, And it is evil to Moses for their sakes,

**³³** For they have provoked his spirit, And he speaketh wrongfully with his lips.

**³⁴** They have not destroyed the peoples, As Jehovah had said to them,

**³⁵** And mix themselves among nations, and learn their works,

**³⁶** And serve their idols, And they are to them for a snare.

**³⁷** And they sacrifice their sons And their daughters to destroyers,

**³⁸** And they shed innocent blood — Blood of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they have sacrificed to idols of Canaan, And the land is profaned with blood.

**³⁹** And they are defiled with their works, And commit whoredom in their habitual doings.

**⁴⁰** And the anger of Jehovah Is kindled against His people, And He doth abominate His inheritance.

**⁴¹** And giveth them into the hand of nations, And those hating them rule over them,

**⁴²** And their enemies oppress them, And they are humbled under their hand.

**⁴³** Many times He doth deliver them, And they rebel in their counsel, And they are brought low in their iniquity.

**⁴⁴** And He looketh on their distress When He heareth their cry,

**⁴⁵** And remembereth for them His covenant, And is comforted, According to the abundance of His kindness.

**⁴⁶** And He appointeth them for mercies Before all their captors.

**⁴⁷** Save us, O Jehovah our God, and gather us from the nations, To give thanks to Thy holy name, To glory in Thy praise.

**⁴⁸** Blessed [is] Jehovah, God of Israel, From the age even unto the age. And all the people said, 'Amen, praise Jah!'
