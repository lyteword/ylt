# Psalm 107

<sup>1</sup> 'Give ye thanks to Jehovah, For good, for to the age [is] His kindness:'

<sup>2</sup> Let the redeemed of Jehovah say, Whom He redeemed from the hand of an adversary.

<sup>3</sup> And from the lands hath gathered them, From east and from west, From north, and from the sea.

<sup>4</sup> They wandered in a wilderness, in a desert by the way, A city of habitation they have not found.

<sup>5</sup> Hungry — yea — thirsty, Their soul in them becometh feeble,

<sup>6</sup> And they cry unto Jehovah in their adversity, From their distress He delivereth them,

<sup>7</sup> And causeth them to tread in a right way, To go unto a city of habitation.

<sup>8</sup> They confess to Jehovah His kindness, And His wonders to the sons of men.

<sup>9</sup> For He hath satisfied a longing soul, And a hungry soul hath filled [with] goodness.

<sup>10</sup> Inhabitants of dark places and death-shade, Prisoners of affliction and of iron,

<sup>11</sup> Because they changed the saying of God, And the counsel of the Most High despised.

<sup>12</sup> And He humbleth with labour their heart, They have been feeble, and there is no helper.

<sup>13</sup> And they cry unto Jehovah in their adversity, From their distresses He saveth them.

<sup>14</sup> He bringeth them out from the dark place, And death-shade, And their bands He draweth away.

<sup>15</sup> They confess to Jehovah His kindness, And His wonders to the sons of men.

<sup>16</sup> For He hath broken doors of brass, And bars of iron He hath cut.

<sup>17</sup> Fools, by means of their transgression, And by their iniquities, afflict themselves.

<sup>18</sup> All food doth their soul abominate, And they come nigh unto the gates of death,

<sup>19</sup> And cry unto Jehovah in their adversity, From their distresses He saveth them,

<sup>20</sup> He sendeth His word and healeth them, And delivereth from their destructions.

<sup>21</sup> They confess to Jehovah His kindness, And His wonders to the sons of men,

<sup>22</sup> And they sacrifice sacrifices of thanksgiving, And recount His works with singing.

<sup>23</sup> Those going down [to] the sea in ships, Doing business in many waters,

<sup>24</sup> They have seen the works of Jehovah, And His wonders in the deep.

<sup>25</sup> And He saith, and appointeth a tempest, And it lifteth up its billows,

<sup>26</sup> They go up [to] the heavens, they go down [to] the depths, Their soul in evil is melted.

<sup>27</sup> They reel to and fro, and move as a drunkard, And all their wisdom is swallowed up.

<sup>28</sup> And they cry to Jehovah in their adversity, And from their distresses He bringeth them out.

<sup>29</sup> He establisheth a whirlwind to a calm, And hushed are their billows.

<sup>30</sup> And they rejoice because they are quiet, And He leadeth them to the haven of their desire.

<sup>31</sup> They confess to Jehovah His kindness, And His wonders to the sons of men,

<sup>32</sup> And they exalt Him in the assembly of the people, And in the seat of the elders praise Him.

<sup>33</sup> He maketh rivers become a wilderness, And fountains of waters become dry land.

<sup>34</sup> A fruitful land becometh a barren place, For the wickedness of its inhabitants.

<sup>35</sup> He maketh a wilderness become a pool of water, And a dry land become fountains of waters.

<sup>36</sup> And He causeth the hungry to dwell there, And they prepare a city of habitation.

<sup>37</sup> And they sow fields, and plant vineyards, And they make fruits of increase.

<sup>38</sup> And He blesseth them, and they multiply exceedingly, And their cattle He doth not diminish.

<sup>39</sup> And they are diminished, and bow down, By restraint, evil, and sorrow.

<sup>40</sup> He is pouring contempt upon nobles, And causeth them to wander in vacancy — no way.

<sup>41</sup> And setteth on high the needy from affliction, And placeth families as a flock.

<sup>42</sup> The upright do see and rejoice, And all perversity hath shut her mouth.

<sup>43</sup> Who [is] wise, and observeth these? They understand the kind acts of Jehovah!
