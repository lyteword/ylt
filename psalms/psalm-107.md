# Psalm 107

**¹** 'Give ye thanks to Jehovah, For good, for to the age [is] His kindness:'

**²** Let the redeemed of Jehovah say, Whom He redeemed from the hand of an adversary.

**³** And from the lands hath gathered them, From east and from west, From north, and from the sea.

**⁴** They wandered in a wilderness, in a desert by the way, A city of habitation they have not found.

**⁵** Hungry — yea — thirsty, Their soul in them becometh feeble,

**⁶** And they cry unto Jehovah in their adversity, From their distress He delivereth them,

**⁷** And causeth them to tread in a right way, To go unto a city of habitation.

**⁸** They confess to Jehovah His kindness, And His wonders to the sons of men.

**⁹** For He hath satisfied a longing soul, And a hungry soul hath filled [with] goodness.

**¹⁰** Inhabitants of dark places and death-shade, Prisoners of affliction and of iron,

**¹¹** Because they changed the saying of God, And the counsel of the Most High despised.

**¹²** And He humbleth with labour their heart, They have been feeble, and there is no helper.

**¹³** And they cry unto Jehovah in their adversity, From their distresses He saveth them.

**¹⁴** He bringeth them out from the dark place, And death-shade, And their bands He draweth away.

**¹⁵** They confess to Jehovah His kindness, And His wonders to the sons of men.

**¹⁶** For He hath broken doors of brass, And bars of iron He hath cut.

**¹⁷** Fools, by means of their transgression, And by their iniquities, afflict themselves.

**¹⁸** All food doth their soul abominate, And they come nigh unto the gates of death,

**¹⁹** And cry unto Jehovah in their adversity, From their distresses He saveth them,

**²⁰** He sendeth His word and healeth them, And delivereth from their destructions.

**²¹** They confess to Jehovah His kindness, And His wonders to the sons of men,

**²²** And they sacrifice sacrifices of thanksgiving, And recount His works with singing.

**²³** Those going down [to] the sea in ships, Doing business in many waters,

**²⁴** They have seen the works of Jehovah, And His wonders in the deep.

**²⁵** And He saith, and appointeth a tempest, And it lifteth up its billows,

**²⁶** They go up [to] the heavens, they go down [to] the depths, Their soul in evil is melted.

**²⁷** They reel to and fro, and move as a drunkard, And all their wisdom is swallowed up.

**²⁸** And they cry to Jehovah in their adversity, And from their distresses He bringeth them out.

**²⁹** He establisheth a whirlwind to a calm, And hushed are their billows.

**³⁰** And they rejoice because they are quiet, And He leadeth them to the haven of their desire.

**³¹** They confess to Jehovah His kindness, And His wonders to the sons of men,

**³²** And they exalt Him in the assembly of the people, And in the seat of the elders praise Him.

**³³** He maketh rivers become a wilderness, And fountains of waters become dry land.

**³⁴** A fruitful land becometh a barren place, For the wickedness of its inhabitants.

**³⁵** He maketh a wilderness become a pool of water, And a dry land become fountains of waters.

**³⁶** And He causeth the hungry to dwell there, And they prepare a city of habitation.

**³⁷** And they sow fields, and plant vineyards, And they make fruits of increase.

**³⁸** And He blesseth them, and they multiply exceedingly, And their cattle He doth not diminish.

**³⁹** And they are diminished, and bow down, By restraint, evil, and sorrow.

**⁴⁰** He is pouring contempt upon nobles, And causeth them to wander in vacancy — no way.

**⁴¹** And setteth on high the needy from affliction, And placeth families as a flock.

**⁴²** The upright do see and rejoice, And all perversity hath shut her mouth.

**⁴³** Who [is] wise, and observeth these? They understand the kind acts of Jehovah!
