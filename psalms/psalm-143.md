# Psalm 143

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. O Jehovah, hear my prayer, Give ear unto my supplications, In Thy faithfulness answer me — in Thy righteousness.

<sup>2</sup> And enter not into judgment with Thy servant, For no one living is justified before Thee.

<sup>3</sup> For an enemy hath pursued my soul, He hath bruised to the earth my life, He hath caused me to dwell in dark places, As the dead of old.

<sup>4</sup> And my spirit in me is become feeble, Within me is my heart become desolate.

<sup>5</sup> I have remembered days of old, I have meditated on all Thine acts, On the work of Thy hand I muse.

<sup>6</sup> I have spread forth my hands unto Thee, My soul [is] as a weary land for Thee. Selah.

<sup>7</sup> Haste, answer me, O Jehovah, My spirit hath been consumed, Hide not Thou Thy face from me, Or I have been compared with those going down [to] the pit.

<sup>8</sup> Cause me to hear in the morning Thy kindness, For in Thee I have trusted, Cause me to know the way that I go, For unto Thee I have lifted up my soul.

<sup>9</sup> Deliver me from mine enemies, O Jehovah, Near Thee I am covered.

<sup>10</sup> Teach me to do Thy good pleasure, For Thou [art] my God — Thy Spirit [is] good, Lead me into a land of uprightness.

<sup>11</sup> For Thy name's sake O Jehovah, Thou dost quicken me, In Thy righteousness, Thou bringest out from distress my soul,

<sup>12</sup> And in Thy kindness cuttest off mine enemies, And hast destroyed all the adversaries of my soul, For I [am] Thy servant!
