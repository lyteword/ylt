# Psalm 77 

**¹** To the Overseer, for Jeduthun. — A Psalm of Asaph. My voice [is] to God, and I cry, my voice [is] to God, And He hath given ear unto me.

**²** In a day of my distress the Lord I sought, My hand by night hath been spread out, And it doth not cease, My soul hath refused to be comforted.

**³** I remember God, and make a noise, I meditate, and feeble is my spirit. Selah.

**⁴** Thou hast taken hold of the watches of mine eyes, I have been moved, and I speak not.

**⁵** I have reckoned the days of old, The years of the ages.

**⁶** I remember my music in the night, With my heart I meditate, and my spirit doth search diligently:

**⁷** To the ages doth the Lord cast off? Doth He add to be pleased no more?

**⁸** Hath His kindness ceased for ever? The saying failed to all generations?

**⁹** Hath God forgotten [His] favours? Hath He shut up in anger His mercies? Selah.

**¹⁰** And I say: 'My weakness is, The changes of the right hand of the Most High.'

**¹¹** I mention the doings of Jah, For I remember of old Thy wonders,

**¹²** And I have meditated on all Thy working, And I talk concerning Thy doings.

**¹³** O God, in holiness [is] Thy way, Who [is] a great god like God?

**¹⁴** Thou [art] the God doing wonders. Thou hast made known among the peoples Thy strength,

**¹⁵** Thou hast redeemed with strength Thy people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.

**¹⁶** The waters have seen Thee, O God, The waters have seen Thee, They are afraid — also depths are troubled.

**¹⁷** Poured out waters have thick clouds, The skies have given forth a noise, Also — Thine arrows go up and down.

**¹⁸** The voice of Thy thunder [is] in the spheres, Lightnings have lightened the world, The earth hath trembled, yea, it shaketh.

**¹⁹** In the sea [is] Thy way, And Thy paths [are] in many waters, And Thy tracks have not been known.

**²⁰** Thou hast led as a flock Thy people, By the hand of Moses and Aaron!
