# Psalm 129

**¹** A Song of the Ascents. Often they distressed me from my youth, Pray, let Israel say:

**²** Often they distressed me from my youth, Yet they have not prevailed over me.

**³** Over my back have ploughers ploughed, They have made long their furrows.

**⁴** Jehovah [is] righteous, He hath cut asunder cords of the wicked.

**⁵** Confounded and turn backward do all hating Zion.

**⁶** They are as grass of the roofs, That before it was drawn out withereth,

**⁷** That hath not filled the hand of a reaper, And the bosom of a binder of sheaves.

**⁸** And the passers by have not said, 'The blessing of Jehovah [is] on you, We blessed you in the Name of Jehovah!'
