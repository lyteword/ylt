# Psalm 129

<sup>1</sup> A Song of the Ascents. Often they distressed me from my youth, Pray, let Israel say:

<sup>2</sup> Often they distressed me from my youth, Yet they have not prevailed over me.

<sup>3</sup> Over my back have ploughers ploughed, They have made long their furrows.

<sup>4</sup> Jehovah [is] righteous, He hath cut asunder cords of the wicked.

<sup>5</sup> Confounded and turn backward do all hating Zion.

<sup>6</sup> They are as grass of the roofs, That before it was drawn out withereth,

<sup>7</sup> That hath not filled the hand of a reaper, And the bosom of a binder of sheaves.

<sup>8</sup> And the passers by have not said, 'The blessing of Jehovah [is] on you, We blessed you in the Name of Jehovah!'
