# Psalm 28 

**¹** By David. Unto Thee, O Jehovah, I call, My rock, be not silent to me! Lest Thou be silent to me, And I have been compared With those going down to the pit.

**²** Hear the voice of my supplications, In my crying unto Thee, In my lifting up my hands toward thy holy oracle.

**³** Draw me not with the wicked, And with workers of iniquity, Speaking peace with their neighbours, And evil in their heart.

**⁴** Give to them according to their acting, And according to the evil of their doings. According to the work of their hands give to them. Return their deed to them.

**⁵** For they attend not to the doing of Jehovah, And unto the work of His hands. He throweth them down, And doth not build them up.

**⁶** Blessed [is] Jehovah, For He hath heard the voice of my supplications.

**⁷** Jehovah [is] my strength, and my shield, In Him my heart trusted, and I have been helped. And my heart exulteth, And with my song I thank Him.

**⁸** Jehovah [is] strength to him, Yea, the strength of the salvation of His anointed [is] He.

**⁹** Save Thy people, and bless Thine inheritance, And feed them, and carry them to the age!
