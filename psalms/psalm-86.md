# Psalm 86

<sup>1</sup> A Prayer of David. Incline, O Jehovah, Thine ear, Answer me, for I [am] poor and needy.

<sup>2</sup> Keep my soul, for I [am] pious, Save Thy servant — who is trusting to Thee, O Thou, my God.

<sup>3</sup> Favour me, O Lord, for to Thee I call all the day.

<sup>4</sup> Rejoice the soul of Thy servant, For unto Thee, O Lord, my soul I lift up.

<sup>5</sup> For Thou, Lord, [art] good and forgiving. And abundant in kindness to all calling Thee.

<sup>6</sup> Hear, O Jehovah, my prayer, And attend to the voice of my supplications.

<sup>7</sup> In a day of my distress I call Thee, For Thou dost answer me.

<sup>8</sup> There is none like Thee among the gods, O Lord, And like Thy works there are none.

<sup>9</sup> All nations that Thou hast made Come and bow themselves before Thee, O Lord, And give honour to Thy name.

<sup>10</sup> For great [art] Thou, and doing wonders, Thou [art] God Thyself alone.

<sup>11</sup> Show me, O Jehovah, Thy way, I walk in Thy truth, My heart doth rejoice to fear Thy name.

<sup>12</sup> I confess Thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart, And I honour Thy name to the age.

<sup>13</sup> For Thy kindness [is] great toward me, And Thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol.

<sup>14</sup> O God, the proud have risen up against me, And a company of the terrible sought my soul, And have not placed Thee before them,

<sup>15</sup> And Thou, O Lord, [art] God, merciful and gracious, Slow to anger, and abundant in kindness and truth.

<sup>16</sup> Look unto me, and favour me, Give Thy strength to Thy servant, And give salvation to a son of Thine handmaid.

<sup>17</sup> Do with me a sign for good, And those hating me see and are ashamed, For Thou, O Jehovah, hast helped me, Yea, Thou hast comforted me!
