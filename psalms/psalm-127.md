# Psalm 127

<sup>1</sup> A Song of the Ascents, by Solomon. If Jehovah doth not build the house, In vain have its builders laboured at it, If Jehovah doth not watch a city, In vain hath a watchman waked.

<sup>2</sup> Vain for you who are rising early, Who delay sitting, eating the bread of griefs, So He giveth to His beloved one sleep.

<sup>3</sup> Lo, an inheritance of Jehovah [are] sons, A reward [is] the fruit of the womb.

<sup>4</sup> As arrows in the hand of a mighty one, So [are] the sons of the young men.

<sup>5</sup> O the happiness of the man Who hath filled his quiver with them, They are not ashamed, For they speak with enemies in the gate!
