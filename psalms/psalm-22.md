# Psalm 22 

**¹** To the Overseer, on 'The Hind of the Morning.' — A Psalm of David. My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me? Far from my salvation, The words of my roaring?

**²** My God, I call by day, and Thou answerest not, And by night, and there is no silence to me.

**³** And Thou [art] holy, Sitting — the Praise of Israel.

**⁴** In Thee did our fathers trust — they trusted, And Thou dost deliver them.

**⁵** Unto Thee they cried, and were delivered, In Thee they trusted, and were not ashamed.

**⁶** And I [am] a worm, and no man, A reproach of man, and despised of the people.

**⁷** All beholding me do mock at me, They make free with the lip — shake the head,

**⁸** 'Roll unto Jehovah, He doth deliver him, He doth deliver him, for he delighted in him.'

**⁹** For thou [art] He bringing me forth from the womb, Causing me to trust, On the breasts of my mother.

**¹⁰** On Thee I have been cast from the womb, From the belly of my mother Thou [art] my God.

**¹¹** Be not far from me, For adversity is near, for there is no helper.

**¹²** Many bulls have surrounded me, Mighty ones of Bashan have compassed me,

**¹³** They have opened against me their mouth, A lion tearing and roaring.

**¹⁴** As waters I have been poured out, And separated themselves have all my bones, My heart hath been like wax, It is melted in the midst of my bowels.

**¹⁵** Dried up as an earthen vessel is my power, And my tongue is cleaving to my jaws.

**¹⁶** And to the dust of death thou appointest me, For surrounded me have dogs, A company of evil doers have compassed me, Piercing my hands and my feet.

**¹⁷** I count all my bones — they look expectingly, They look upon me,

**¹⁸** They apportion my garments to themselves, And for my clothing they cause a lot to fall.

**¹⁹** And Thou, O Jehovah, be not far off, O my strength, to help me haste.

**²⁰** Deliver from the sword my soul, From the paw of a dog mine only one.

**²¹** Save me from the mouth of a lion: — And — from the horns of the high places Thou hast answered me!

**²²** I declare Thy name to my brethren, In the midst of the assembly I praise Thee.

**²³** Ye who fear Jehovah, praise ye Him, All the seed of Jacob, honour ye Him, And be afraid of Him, all ye seed of Israel.

**²⁴** For He hath not despised, nor abominated, The affliction of the afflicted, Nor hath He hidden His face from him, And in his crying unto Him He heareth.

**²⁵** Of Thee my praise [is] in the great assembly. My vows I complete before His fearers.

**²⁶** The humble do eat and are satisfied, Praise Jehovah do those seeking Him, Your heart doth live for ever.

**²⁷** Remember and return unto Jehovah, Do all ends of the earth, And before Thee bow themselves, Do all families of the nations,

**²⁸** For to Jehovah [is] the kingdom, And He is ruling among nations.

**²⁹** And the fat ones of earth have eaten, And they bow themselves, Before Him bow do all going down to dust, And he [who] hath not revived his soul.

**³⁰** A seed doth serve Him, It is declared of the Lord to the generation.

**³¹** They come and declare His righteousness, To a people that is borne, that He hath made!
