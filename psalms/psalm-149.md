# Psalm 149

<sup>1</sup> Praise ye Jah! Sing ye to Jehovah a new song, His praise in an assembly of saints.

<sup>2</sup> Israel doth rejoice in his Maker, Sons of Zion do joy in their king.

<sup>3</sup> They praise His name in a dance, With timbrel and harp sing praise to Him.

<sup>4</sup> For Jehovah is pleased with His people, He beautifieth the humble with salvation.

<sup>5</sup> Exult do saints in honour, They sing aloud on their beds.

<sup>6</sup> The exaltation of God [is] in their throat, And a two-edged sword in their hand.

<sup>7</sup> To do vengeance among nations, Punishments among the peoples.

<sup>8</sup> To bind their kings with chains, And their honoured ones with fetters of iron,

<sup>9</sup> To do among them the judgment written, An honour it [is] for all his saints. Praise ye Jah!
