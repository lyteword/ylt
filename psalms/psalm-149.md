# Psalm 149 

**¹** Praise ye Jah! Sing ye to Jehovah a new song, His praise in an assembly of saints.

**²** Israel doth rejoice in his Maker, Sons of Zion do joy in their king.

**³** They praise His name in a dance, With timbrel and harp sing praise to Him.

**⁴** For Jehovah is pleased with His people, He beautifieth the humble with salvation.

**⁵** Exult do saints in honour, They sing aloud on their beds.

**⁶** The exaltation of God [is] in their throat, And a two-edged sword in their hand.

**⁷** To do vengeance among nations, Punishments among the peoples.

**⁸** To bind their kings with chains, And their honoured ones with fetters of iron,

**⁹** To do among them the judgment written, An honour it [is] for all his saints. Praise ye Jah!
