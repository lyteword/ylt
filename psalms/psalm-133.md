# Psalm 133

<sup>1</sup> A Song of the Ascents, by David. Lo, how good and how pleasant The dwelling of brethren — even together!

<sup>2</sup> As the good oil on the head, Coming down on the beard, the beard of Aaron, That cometh down on the skirt of his robes,

<sup>3</sup> As dew of Hermon — That cometh down on hills of Zion, For there Jehovah commanded the blessing — Life unto the age!
