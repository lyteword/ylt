# Psalm 142 

**¹** An Instruction of David, a Prayer when he is in the cave. My voice [is] unto Jehovah, I cry, My voice [is] unto Jehovah, I entreat grace.

**²** I pour forth before Him my meditation, My distress before Him I declare.

**³** When my spirit hath been feeble in me, Then Thou hast known my path; In the way [in] which I walk, They have hid a snare for me.

**⁴** Looking on the right hand — and seeing, And I have none recognizing; Perished hath refuge from me, There is none inquiring for my soul.

**⁵** I have cried unto thee, O Jehovah, I have said, 'Thou [art] my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.'

**⁶** Attend Thou unto my loud cry, For I have become very low, Deliver Thou me from my pursuers, For they have been stronger than I.

**⁷** Bring forth from prison my soul to confess Thy name, The righteous do compass me about, When Thou conferrest benefits upon me!
