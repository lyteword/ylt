# Psalm 142

<sup>1</sup> An Instruction of David, a Prayer when he is in the cave. My voice [is] unto Jehovah, I cry, My voice [is] unto Jehovah, I entreat grace.

<sup>2</sup> I pour forth before Him my meditation, My distress before Him I declare.

<sup>3</sup> When my spirit hath been feeble in me, Then Thou hast known my path; In the way [in] which I walk, They have hid a snare for me.

<sup>4</sup> Looking on the right hand — and seeing, And I have none recognizing; Perished hath refuge from me, There is none inquiring for my soul.

<sup>5</sup> I have cried unto thee, O Jehovah, I have said, 'Thou [art] my refuge, My portion in the land of the living.'

<sup>6</sup> Attend Thou unto my loud cry, For I have become very low, Deliver Thou me from my pursuers, For they have been stronger than I.

<sup>7</sup> Bring forth from prison my soul to confess Thy name, The righteous do compass me about, When Thou conferrest benefits upon me!
