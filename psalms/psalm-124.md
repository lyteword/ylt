# Psalm 124

<sup>1</sup> A Song of the Ascents, by David. Save [for] Jehovah — who hath been for us, (Pray, let Israel say),

<sup>2</sup> Save [for] Jehovah — who hath been for us, In the rising up of man against us,

<sup>3</sup> Then alive they had swallowed us up, In the burning of their anger against us,

<sup>4</sup> Then the waters had overflowed us, The stream passed over our soul,

<sup>5</sup> Then passed over our soul had the proud waters.

<sup>6</sup> Blessed [is] Jehovah who hath not given us, A prey to their teeth.

<sup>7</sup> Our soul as a bird hath escaped from a snare of fowlers, The snare was broken, and we have escaped.

<sup>8</sup> Our help [is] in the name of Jehovah, Maker of the heavens and earth!
