# Psalm 124 

**¹** A Song of the Ascents, by David. Save [for] Jehovah — who hath been for us, (Pray, let Israel say),

**²** Save [for] Jehovah — who hath been for us, In the rising up of man against us,

**³** Then alive they had swallowed us up, In the burning of their anger against us,

**⁴** Then the waters had overflowed us, The stream passed over our soul,

**⁵** Then passed over our soul had the proud waters.

**⁶** Blessed [is] Jehovah who hath not given us, A prey to their teeth.

**⁷** Our soul as a bird hath escaped from a snare of fowlers, The snare was broken, and we have escaped.

**⁸** Our help [is] in the name of Jehovah, Maker of the heavens and earth!
