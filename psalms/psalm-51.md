# Psalm 51 

**¹** To the Overseer. — A Psalm of David, in the coming in unto him of Nathan the prophet, when he hath gone in unto Bath-Sheba. Favour me, O God, according to Thy kindness, According to the abundance of Thy mercies, Blot out my transgressions.

**²** Thoroughly wash me from mine iniquity, And from my sin cleanse me,

**³** For my transgressions I do know, And my sin [is] before me continually.

**⁴** Against Thee, Thee only, I have sinned, And done the evil thing in Thine eyes, So that Thou art righteous in Thy words, Thou art pure in Thy judging.

**⁵** Lo, in iniquity I have been brought forth, And in sin doth my mother conceive me.

**⁶** Lo, truth Thou hast desired in the inward parts, And in the hidden part Wisdom Thou causest me to know.

**⁷** Thou cleansest me with hyssop and I am clean, Washest me, and than snow I am whiter.

**⁸** Thou causest me to hear joy and gladness, Thou makest joyful bones Thou hast bruised.

**⁹** Hide Thy face from my sin. And all mine iniquities blot out.

**¹⁰** A clean heart prepare for me, O God, And a right spirit renew within me.

**¹¹** Cast me not forth from Thy presence, And Thy Holy Spirit take not from me.

**¹²** Restore to me the joy of Thy salvation, And a willing spirit doth sustain me.

**¹³** I teach transgressors Thy ways, And sinners unto Thee do return.

**¹⁴** Deliver me from blood, O God, God of my salvation, My tongue singeth of Thy righteousness.

**¹⁵** O Lord, my lips thou dost open, And my mouth declareth Thy praise.

**¹⁶** For Thou desirest not sacrifice, or I give [it], Burnt-offering Thou acceptest not.

**¹⁷** The sacrifices of God [are] a broken spirit, A heart broken and bruised, O God, Thou dost not despise.

**¹⁸** Do good in Thy good pleasure with Zion, Thou dost build the walls of Jerusalem.

**¹⁹** Then Thou desirest sacrifices of righteousness, Burnt-offering, and whole burnt-offering, Then they offer bullocks on thine altar!
