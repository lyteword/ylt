# Psalm 51

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer. — A Psalm of David, in the coming in unto him of Nathan the prophet, when he hath gone in unto Bath-Sheba. Favour me, O God, according to Thy kindness, According to the abundance of Thy mercies, Blot out my transgressions.

<sup>2</sup> Thoroughly wash me from mine iniquity, And from my sin cleanse me,

<sup>3</sup> For my transgressions I do know, And my sin [is] before me continually.

<sup>4</sup> Against Thee, Thee only, I have sinned, And done the evil thing in Thine eyes, So that Thou art righteous in Thy words, Thou art pure in Thy judging.

<sup>5</sup> Lo, in iniquity I have been brought forth, And in sin doth my mother conceive me.

<sup>6</sup> Lo, truth Thou hast desired in the inward parts, And in the hidden part Wisdom Thou causest me to know.

<sup>7</sup> Thou cleansest me with hyssop and I am clean, Washest me, and than snow I am whiter.

<sup>8</sup> Thou causest me to hear joy and gladness, Thou makest joyful bones Thou hast bruised.

<sup>9</sup> Hide Thy face from my sin. And all mine iniquities blot out.

<sup>10</sup> A clean heart prepare for me, O God, And a right spirit renew within me.

<sup>11</sup> Cast me not forth from Thy presence, And Thy Holy Spirit take not from me.

<sup>12</sup> Restore to me the joy of Thy salvation, And a willing spirit doth sustain me.

<sup>13</sup> I teach transgressors Thy ways, And sinners unto Thee do return.

<sup>14</sup> Deliver me from blood, O God, God of my salvation, My tongue singeth of Thy righteousness.

<sup>15</sup> O Lord, my lips thou dost open, And my mouth declareth Thy praise.

<sup>16</sup> For Thou desirest not sacrifice, or I give [it], Burnt-offering Thou acceptest not.

<sup>17</sup> The sacrifices of God [are] a broken spirit, A heart broken and bruised, O God, Thou dost not despise.

<sup>18</sup> Do good in Thy good pleasure with Zion, Thou dost build the walls of Jerusalem.

<sup>19</sup> Then Thou desirest sacrifices of righteousness, Burnt-offering, and whole burnt-offering, Then they offer bullocks on thine altar!
