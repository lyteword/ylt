# Psalm 68

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer. — A Psalm, a song of David. Rise doth God — scattered are His enemies! And those hating Him flee from His face.

<sup>2</sup> As the driving away of smoke Thou drivest away, As the melting of wax before fire, The wicked perish at the presence of God.

<sup>3</sup> And the righteous rejoice, they exult before God, And they joy with gladness.

<sup>4</sup> Sing ye to God — praise His name, Raise up a highway for Him who is riding in deserts, In Jah [is] His name, and exult before Him.

<sup>5</sup> Father of the fatherless, and judge of the widows, [Is] God in His holy habitation.

<sup>6</sup> God — causing the lonely to dwell at home, Bringing out bound ones into prosperity, Only — the refractory have inhabited a dry place.

<sup>7</sup> O God, in Thy going forth before Thy people, In Thy stepping through the wilderness, Selah.

<sup>8</sup> The earth hath shaken, Yea, the heavens have dropped before God, This Sinai — before God, the God of Israel.

<sup>9</sup> A shower of free-will gifts thou shakest out, O God. Thine inheritance, when it hath been weary, Thou hast established it.

<sup>10</sup> Thy company have dwelt in it, Thou preparest in Thy goodness for the poor, O God.

<sup>11</sup> The Lord doth give the saying, The female proclaimers [are] a numerous host.

<sup>12</sup> Kings of hosts flee utterly away, And a female inhabitant of the house apportioneth spoil.

<sup>13</sup> Though ye do lie between two boundaries, Wings of a dove covered with silver, And her pinions with yellow gold.

<sup>14</sup> When the Mighty spreadeth kings in it, It doth snow in Salmon.

<sup>15</sup> A hill of God [is] the hill of Bashan, A hill of heights [is] the hill of Bashan.

<sup>16</sup> Why do ye envy, O high hills, The hill God hath desired for His seat? Jehovah also doth tabernacle for ever.

<sup>17</sup> The chariots of God [are] myriads, thousands of changes, The Lord [is] among them, in Sinai, in the sanctuary.

<sup>18</sup> Thou hast ascended on high, Thou hast taken captive captivity, Thou hast taken gifts for men, That even the refractory may rest, O Jah God.

<sup>19</sup> Blessed [is] the Lord, day by day He layeth on us. God Himself [is] our salvation. Selah.

<sup>20</sup> God Himself [is] to us a God for deliverances, And Jehovah Lord hath the outgoings of death.

<sup>21</sup> Only — God doth smite The head of His enemies, The hairy crown of a habitual walker in his guilt.

<sup>22</sup> The Lord said: 'From Bashan I bring back, I bring back from the depths of the sea.

<sup>23</sup> So that thou dashest thy foot in blood, [In the blood of] enemies — the tongue of Thy dogs.'

<sup>24</sup> They have seen Thy goings, O God, Goings of my God, my king, in the sanctuary.

<sup>25</sup> Singers have been before, Behind [are] players on instruments, In the midst virgins playing with timbrels.

<sup>26</sup> In assemblies bless ye God, The Lord — from the fountain of Israel.

<sup>27</sup> There [is] little Benjamin their ruler, Heads of Judah their defence, Heads of Zebulun — heads of Naphtali.

<sup>28</sup> Thy God hath commanded thy strength, Be strong, O God, this Thou hast wrought for us.

<sup>29</sup> Because of Thy temple at Jerusalem, To Thee do kings bring a present.

<sup>30</sup> Rebuke a beast of the reeds, a company of bulls, With calves of the peoples, Each humbling himself with pieces of silver, Scatter Thou peoples delighting in conflicts.

<sup>31</sup> Come do fat ones out of Egypt, Cush causeth her hands to run to God.

<sup>32</sup> Kingdoms of the earth, sing ye to God, Praise ye the Lord. Selah.

<sup>33</sup> To him who is riding on the heavens of the heavens of old, Lo, He giveth with His voice a strong voice.

<sup>34</sup> Ascribe ye strength to God, Over Israel [is] His excellency, and His strength in the clouds.

<sup>35</sup> Fearful, O God, out of Thy sanctuaries, The God of Israel Himself, Giving strength and might to the people. Blessed [is] God!
