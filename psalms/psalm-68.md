# Psalm 68

**¹** To the Overseer. — A Psalm, a song of David. Rise doth God — scattered are His enemies! And those hating Him flee from His face.

**²** As the driving away of smoke Thou drivest away, As the melting of wax before fire, The wicked perish at the presence of God.

**³** And the righteous rejoice, they exult before God, And they joy with gladness.

**⁴** Sing ye to God — praise His name, Raise up a highway for Him who is riding in deserts, In Jah [is] His name, and exult before Him.

**⁵** Father of the fatherless, and judge of the widows, [Is] God in His holy habitation.

**⁶** God — causing the lonely to dwell at home, Bringing out bound ones into prosperity, Only — the refractory have inhabited a dry place.

**⁷** O God, in Thy going forth before Thy people, In Thy stepping through the wilderness, Selah.

**⁸** The earth hath shaken, Yea, the heavens have dropped before God, This Sinai — before God, the God of Israel.

**⁹** A shower of free-will gifts thou shakest out, O God. Thine inheritance, when it hath been weary, Thou hast established it.

**¹⁰** Thy company have dwelt in it, Thou preparest in Thy goodness for the poor, O God.

**¹¹** The Lord doth give the saying, The female proclaimers [are] a numerous host.

**¹²** Kings of hosts flee utterly away, And a female inhabitant of the house apportioneth spoil.

**¹³** Though ye do lie between two boundaries, Wings of a dove covered with silver, And her pinions with yellow gold.

**¹⁴** When the Mighty spreadeth kings in it, It doth snow in Salmon.

**¹⁵** A hill of God [is] the hill of Bashan, A hill of heights [is] the hill of Bashan.

**¹⁶** Why do ye envy, O high hills, The hill God hath desired for His seat? Jehovah also doth tabernacle for ever.

**¹⁷** The chariots of God [are] myriads, thousands of changes, The Lord [is] among them, in Sinai, in the sanctuary.

**¹⁸** Thou hast ascended on high, Thou hast taken captive captivity, Thou hast taken gifts for men, That even the refractory may rest, O Jah God.

**¹⁹** Blessed [is] the Lord, day by day He layeth on us. God Himself [is] our salvation. Selah.

**²⁰** God Himself [is] to us a God for deliverances, And Jehovah Lord hath the outgoings of death.

**²¹** Only — God doth smite The head of His enemies, The hairy crown of a habitual walker in his guilt.

**²²** The Lord said: 'From Bashan I bring back, I bring back from the depths of the sea.

**²³** So that thou dashest thy foot in blood, [In the blood of] enemies — the tongue of Thy dogs.'

**²⁴** They have seen Thy goings, O God, Goings of my God, my king, in the sanctuary.

**²⁵** Singers have been before, Behind [are] players on instruments, In the midst virgins playing with timbrels.

**²⁶** In assemblies bless ye God, The Lord — from the fountain of Israel.

**²⁷** There [is] little Benjamin their ruler, Heads of Judah their defence, Heads of Zebulun — heads of Naphtali.

**²⁸** Thy God hath commanded thy strength, Be strong, O God, this Thou hast wrought for us.

**²⁹** Because of Thy temple at Jerusalem, To Thee do kings bring a present.

**³⁰** Rebuke a beast of the reeds, a company of bulls, With calves of the peoples, Each humbling himself with pieces of silver, Scatter Thou peoples delighting in conflicts.

**³¹** Come do fat ones out of Egypt, Cush causeth her hands to run to God.

**³²** Kingdoms of the earth, sing ye to God, Praise ye the Lord. Selah.

**³³** To him who is riding on the heavens of the heavens of old, Lo, He giveth with His voice a strong voice.

**³⁴** Ascribe ye strength to God, Over Israel [is] His excellency, and His strength in the clouds.

**³⁵** Fearful, O God, out of Thy sanctuaries, The God of Israel Himself, Giving strength and might to the people. Blessed [is] God!
