# Psalm 2

**¹** Why have nations tumultuously assembled? And do peoples meditate vanity?

**²** Station themselves do kings of the earth, And princes have been united together, Against Jehovah, and against His Messiah:

**³** 'Let us draw off Their cords, And cast from us Their thick bands.'

**⁴** He who is sitting in the heavens doth laugh, The Lord doth mock at them.

**⁵** Then doth He speak unto them in His anger, And in His wrath He doth trouble them:

**⁶** 'And I — I have anointed My King, Upon Zion — My holy hill.'

**⁷** I declare concerning a statute: Jehovah said unto me, 'My Son Thou [art], I to-day have brought thee forth.

**⁸** Ask of Me and I give nations — thy inheritance, And thy possession — the ends of earth.

**⁹** Thou dost rule them with a sceptre of iron, As a vessel of a potter Thou dost crush them.'

**¹⁰** And now, O kings, act wisely, Be instructed, O judges of earth,

**¹¹** Serve ye Jehovah with fear, And rejoice with trembling.

**¹²** Kiss the Chosen One, lest He be angry, And ye lose the way, When His anger burneth but a little, O the happiness of all trusting in Him!
