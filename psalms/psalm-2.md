# Psalm 2

<sup>1</sup> Why have nations tumultuously assembled? And do peoples meditate vanity?

<sup>2</sup> Station themselves do kings of the earth, And princes have been united together, Against Jehovah, and against His Messiah:

<sup>3</sup> 'Let us draw off Their cords, And cast from us Their thick bands.'

<sup>4</sup> He who is sitting in the heavens doth laugh, The Lord doth mock at them.

<sup>5</sup> Then doth He speak unto them in His anger, And in His wrath He doth trouble them:

<sup>6</sup> 'And I — I have anointed My King, Upon Zion — My holy hill.'

<sup>7</sup> I declare concerning a statute: Jehovah said unto me, 'My Son Thou [art], I to-day have brought thee forth.

<sup>8</sup> Ask of Me and I give nations — thy inheritance, And thy possession — the ends of earth.

<sup>9</sup> Thou dost rule them with a sceptre of iron, As a vessel of a potter Thou dost crush them.'

<sup>10</sup> And now, O kings, act wisely, Be instructed, O judges of earth,

<sup>11</sup> Serve ye Jehovah with fear, And rejoice with trembling.

<sup>12</sup> Kiss the Chosen One, lest He be angry, And ye lose the way, When His anger burneth but a little, O the happiness of all trusting in Him!
