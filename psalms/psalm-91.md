# Psalm 91 

**¹** He who is dwelling In the secret place of the Most High, In the shade of the Mighty lodgeth habitually,

**²** He is saying of Jehovah, 'My refuge, and my bulwark, my God, I trust in Him,'

**³** For He delivereth thee from the snare of a fowler, From a calamitous pestilence.

**⁴** With His pinion He covereth thee over, And under His wings thou dost trust, A shield and buckler [is] His truth.

**⁵** Thou art not afraid of fear by night, Of arrow that flieth by day,

**⁶** Of pestilence in thick darkness that walketh, Of destruction that destroyeth at noon,

**⁷** There fall at thy side a thousand, And a myriad at thy right hand, Unto thee it cometh not nigh.

**⁸** But with thine eyes thou lookest, And the reward of the wicked thou seest,

**⁹** (For Thou, O Jehovah, [art] my refuge,) The Most High thou madest thy habitation.

**¹⁰** Evil happeneth not unto thee, And a plague cometh not near thy tent,

**¹¹** For His messengers He chargeth for thee, To keep thee in all thy ways,

**¹²** On the hands they bear thee up, Lest thou smite against a stone thy foot.

**¹³** On lion and asp thou treadest, Thou trampest young lion and dragon.

**¹⁴** Because in Me he hath delighted, I also deliver him — I set him on high, Because he hath known My name.

**¹⁵** He doth call Me, and I answer him, I [am] with him in distress, I deliver him, and honour him.

**¹⁶** With length of days I satisfy him, And I cause him to look on My salvation!
