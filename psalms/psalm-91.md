# Psalm 91

<sup>1</sup> He who is dwelling In the secret place of the Most High, In the shade of the Mighty lodgeth habitually,

<sup>2</sup> He is saying of Jehovah, 'My refuge, and my bulwark, my God, I trust in Him,'

<sup>3</sup> For He delivereth thee from the snare of a fowler, From a calamitous pestilence.

<sup>4</sup> With His pinion He covereth thee over, And under His wings thou dost trust, A shield and buckler [is] His truth.

<sup>5</sup> Thou art not afraid of fear by night, Of arrow that flieth by day,

<sup>6</sup> Of pestilence in thick darkness that walketh, Of destruction that destroyeth at noon,

<sup>7</sup> There fall at thy side a thousand, And a myriad at thy right hand, Unto thee it cometh not nigh.

<sup>8</sup> But with thine eyes thou lookest, And the reward of the wicked thou seest,

<sup>9</sup> (For Thou, O Jehovah, [art] my refuge,) The Most High thou madest thy habitation.

<sup>10</sup> Evil happeneth not unto thee, And a plague cometh not near thy tent,

<sup>11</sup> For His messengers He chargeth for thee, To keep thee in all thy ways,

<sup>12</sup> On the hands they bear thee up, Lest thou smite against a stone thy foot.

<sup>13</sup> On lion and asp thou treadest, Thou trampest young lion and dragon.

<sup>14</sup> Because in Me he hath delighted, I also deliver him — I set him on high, Because he hath known My name.

<sup>15</sup> He doth call Me, and I answer him, I [am] with him in distress, I deliver him, and honour him.

<sup>16</sup> With length of days I satisfy him, And I cause him to look on My salvation!
