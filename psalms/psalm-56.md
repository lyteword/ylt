# Psalm 56

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer. — 'On the Dumb Dove far off.' — A secret treasure of David, in the Philistines' taking hold of him in Gath. Favour me, O God, for man swallowed me up, All the day fighting he oppresseth me,

<sup>2</sup> Mine enemies have swallowed up all the day, For many [are] fighting against me, O most High,

<sup>3</sup> The day I am afraid I am confident toward Thee.

<sup>4</sup> In God I praise His word, in God I have trusted, I fear not what flesh doth to me.

<sup>5</sup> All the day they wrest my words, Concerning me all their thoughts [are] for evil,

<sup>6</sup> They assemble, they hide, they watch my heels, When they have expected my soul.

<sup>7</sup> By iniquity they escape, In anger the peoples put down, O God.

<sup>8</sup> My wandering Thou hast counted, Thou — place Thou my tear in Thy bottle, Are they not in Thy book?

<sup>9</sup> Then turn back do mine enemies in the day I call. This I have known, that God [is] for me.

<sup>10</sup> In God I praise the word, In Jehovah I praise the word.

<sup>11</sup> In God I trusted, I fear not what man doth to me,

<sup>12</sup> On me, O God, [are] Thy vows, I repay thank-offerings to Thee.

<sup>13</sup> For Thou hast delivered my soul from death, Dost Thou not my feet from falling? To walk habitually before God in the light of the living!
