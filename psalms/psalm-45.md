# Psalm 45

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer. — 'On the Lilies.' — By sons of Korah. — An Instruction. — A song of loves. My heart hath indited a good thing, I am telling my works to a king, My tongue [is] the pen of a speedy writer.

<sup>2</sup> Thou hast been beautified above the sons of men, Grace hath been poured into thy lips, Therefore hath God blessed thee to the age.

<sup>3</sup> Gird Thy sword upon the thigh, O mighty, Thy glory and Thy majesty!

<sup>4</sup> As to Thy majesty — prosper! — ride! Because of truth, and meekness — righteousness, And Thy right hand showeth Thee fearful things.

<sup>5</sup> Thine arrows [are] sharp, — Peoples fall under Thee — In the heart of the enemies of the king.

<sup>6</sup> Thy throne, O God, [is] age-during, and for ever, A sceptre of uprightness [Is] the sceptre of Thy kingdom.

<sup>7</sup> Thou hast loved righteousness and hatest wickedness, Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee, Oil of joy above thy companions.

<sup>8</sup> Myrrh and aloes, cassia! all thy garments, Out of palaces of ivory Stringed instruments have made thee glad.

<sup>9</sup> Daughters of kings [are] among thy precious ones, A queen hath stood at thy right hand, In pure gold of Ophir.

<sup>10</sup> Hearken, O daughter, and see, incline thine ear, And forget thy people, and thy father's house,

<sup>11</sup> And the king doth desire thy beauty, Because he [is] thy lord — bow thyself to him,

<sup>12</sup> And the daughter of Tyre with a present, The rich of the people do appease thy face.

<sup>13</sup> All glory [is] the daughter of the king within, Of gold-embroidered work [is] her clothing.

<sup>14</sup> In divers colours she is brought to the king, Virgins — after her — her companions, Are brought to thee.

<sup>15</sup> They are brought with joy and gladness, They come into the palace of the king.

<sup>16</sup> Instead of thy fathers are thy sons, Thou dost appoint them for princes in all the earth.

<sup>17</sup> I make mention of Thy name in all generations, Therefore do peoples praise Thee, To the age, and for ever!
