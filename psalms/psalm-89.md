# Psalm 89 

**¹** An instruction, by Ethan the Ezrahite. Of the kind acts of Jehovah, to the age I sing, To all generations I make known Thy faithfulness with my mouth,

**²** For I said, 'To the age is kindness built, The heavens! Thou dost establish Thy faithfulness in them.'

**³** I have made a covenant for My chosen, I have sworn to David My servant:

**⁴** 'Even to the age do I establish thy seed, And have built to generation and generation thy throne. Selah.

**⁵** and the heavens confess Thy wonders, O Jehovah, Thy faithfulness also [is] in an assembly of holy ones.

**⁶** For who in the sky, Compareth himself to Jehovah? Is like to Jehovah among sons of the mighty?

**⁷** God is very terrible, In the secret counsel of His holy ones, And fearful over all surrounding Him.

**⁸** O Jehovah, God of Hosts, Who [is] like Thee — a strong Jah? And Thy faithfulness [is] round about Thee.

**⁹** Thou [art] ruler over the pride of the sea, In the lifting up of its billows Thou dost restrain them.

**¹⁰** Thou hast bruised Rahab, as one wounded. With the arm of Thy strength Thou hast scattered Thine enemies.

**¹¹** Thine [are] the heavens — the earth also [is] Thine, The habitable world and its fulness, Thou hast founded them.

**¹²** North and south Thou hast appointed them, Tabor and Hermon in Thy name do sing.

**¹³** Thou hast an arm with might, Strong is Thy hand — high Thy right hand.

**¹⁴** Righteousness and judgment [Are] the fixed place of Thy throne, Kindness and truth go before Thy face.

**¹⁵** O the happiness of the people knowing the shout, O Jehovah, in the light of Thy face they walk habitually.

**¹⁶** In Thy name they rejoice all the day, And in Thy righteousness they are exalted,

**¹⁷** For the beauty of their strength [art] Thou, And in Thy good will is our horn exalted,

**¹⁸** For of Jehovah [is] our shield, And of the Holy One of Israel our king.

**¹⁹** Then Thou hast spoken in vision, To Thy saint, yea, Thou sayest, I have placed help upon a mighty one, Exalted a chosen one out of the people,

**²⁰** I have found David My servant, With My holy oil I have anointed him.

**²¹** With whom My hand is established, My arm also doth strengthen him.

**²²** An enemy exacteth not upon him, And a son of perverseness afflicteth him not.

**²³** And I have beaten down before him his adversaries, And those hating him I plague,

**²⁴** And My faithfulness and kindness [are] with him, And in My name is his horn exalted.

**²⁵** And I have set on the sea his hand, And on the rivers his right hand.

**²⁶** He proclaimeth me: 'Thou [art] my Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation.'

**²⁷** I also first-born do appoint him, Highest of the kings of the earth.

**²⁸** To the age I keep for him My kindness, And My covenant [is] stedfast with him.

**²⁹** And I have set his seed for ever, And his throne as the days of the heavens.

**³⁰** If his sons forsake My law, And in My judgments do not walk;

**³¹** If My statutes they pollute, And My commands do not keep,

**³²** I have looked after with a rod their transgression, And with strokes their iniquity,

**³³** And My kindness I break not from him, Nor do I deal falsely in My faithfulness.

**³⁴** I profane not My covenant, And that which is going forth from My lips I change not.

**³⁵** Once I have sworn by My holiness, I lie not to David,

**³⁶** His seed is to the age, And his throne [is] as the sun before Me,

**³⁷** As the moon it is established — to the age, And the witness in the sky is stedfast. Selah.

**³⁸** And Thou, Thou hast cast off, and dost reject, Thou hast shown Thyself wroth With Thine anointed,

**³⁹** Hast rejected the covenant of Thy servant, Thou hast polluted to the earth his crown,

**⁴⁰** Thou hast broken down all his hedges, Thou hast made his fenced places a ruin.

**⁴¹** Spoiled him have all passing by the way, He hath been a reproach to his neighbours,

**⁴²** Thou hast exalted the right hand of his adversaries, Thou hast caused all his enemies to rejoice.

**⁴³** Also — Thou turnest back the sharpness of his sword, And hast not established him in battle,

**⁴⁴** Hast caused [him] to cease from his brightness, And his throne to the earth hast cast down.

**⁴⁵** Thou hast shortened the days of his youth, Hast covered him over [with] shame. Selah.

**⁴⁶** Till when, O Jehovah, art Thou hidden? For ever doth Thy fury burn as fire?

**⁴⁷** Remember, I pray Thee, what [is] life-time? Wherefore in vain hast Thou created All the sons of men?

**⁴⁸** Who [is] the man that liveth, and doth not see death? He delivereth his soul from the hand of Sheol. Selah.

**⁴⁹** Where [are] Thy former kindnesses, O Lord. Thou hast sworn to David in Thy faithfulness,

**⁵⁰** Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Thy servants, I have borne in my bosom all the strivings of the peoples,

**⁵¹** Wherewith Thine enemies reproached, O Jehovah, Wherewith they have reproached The steps of Thine anointed.

**⁵²** Blessed [is] Jehovah to the age. Amen, and amen!
