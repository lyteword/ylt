# Psalm 89

<sup>1</sup> An instruction, by Ethan the Ezrahite. Of the kind acts of Jehovah, to the age I sing, To all generations I make known Thy faithfulness with my mouth,

<sup>2</sup> For I said, 'To the age is kindness built, The heavens! Thou dost establish Thy faithfulness in them.'

<sup>3</sup> I have made a covenant for My chosen, I have sworn to David My servant:

<sup>4</sup> 'Even to the age do I establish thy seed, And have built to generation and generation thy throne. Selah.

<sup>5</sup> and the heavens confess Thy wonders, O Jehovah, Thy faithfulness also [is] in an assembly of holy ones.

<sup>6</sup> For who in the sky, Compareth himself to Jehovah? Is like to Jehovah among sons of the mighty?

<sup>7</sup> God is very terrible, In the secret counsel of His holy ones, And fearful over all surrounding Him.

<sup>8</sup> O Jehovah, God of Hosts, Who [is] like Thee — a strong Jah? And Thy faithfulness [is] round about Thee.

<sup>9</sup> Thou [art] ruler over the pride of the sea, In the lifting up of its billows Thou dost restrain them.

<sup>10</sup> Thou hast bruised Rahab, as one wounded. With the arm of Thy strength Thou hast scattered Thine enemies.

<sup>11</sup> Thine [are] the heavens — the earth also [is] Thine, The habitable world and its fulness, Thou hast founded them.

<sup>12</sup> North and south Thou hast appointed them, Tabor and Hermon in Thy name do sing.

<sup>13</sup> Thou hast an arm with might, Strong is Thy hand — high Thy right hand.

<sup>14</sup> Righteousness and judgment [Are] the fixed place of Thy throne, Kindness and truth go before Thy face.

<sup>15</sup> O the happiness of the people knowing the shout, O Jehovah, in the light of Thy face they walk habitually.

<sup>16</sup> In Thy name they rejoice all the day, And in Thy righteousness they are exalted,

<sup>17</sup> For the beauty of their strength [art] Thou, And in Thy good will is our horn exalted,

<sup>18</sup> For of Jehovah [is] our shield, And of the Holy One of Israel our king.

<sup>19</sup> Then Thou hast spoken in vision, To Thy saint, yea, Thou sayest, I have placed help upon a mighty one, Exalted a chosen one out of the people,

<sup>20</sup> I have found David My servant, With My holy oil I have anointed him.

<sup>21</sup> With whom My hand is established, My arm also doth strengthen him.

<sup>22</sup> An enemy exacteth not upon him, And a son of perverseness afflicteth him not.

<sup>23</sup> And I have beaten down before him his adversaries, And those hating him I plague,

<sup>24</sup> And My faithfulness and kindness [are] with him, And in My name is his horn exalted.

<sup>25</sup> And I have set on the sea his hand, And on the rivers his right hand.

<sup>26</sup> He proclaimeth me: 'Thou [art] my Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation.'

<sup>27</sup> I also first-born do appoint him, Highest of the kings of the earth.

<sup>28</sup> To the age I keep for him My kindness, And My covenant [is] stedfast with him.

<sup>29</sup> And I have set his seed for ever, And his throne as the days of the heavens.

<sup>30</sup> If his sons forsake My law, And in My judgments do not walk;

<sup>31</sup> If My statutes they pollute, And My commands do not keep,

<sup>32</sup> I have looked after with a rod their transgression, And with strokes their iniquity,

<sup>33</sup> And My kindness I break not from him, Nor do I deal falsely in My faithfulness.

<sup>34</sup> I profane not My covenant, And that which is going forth from My lips I change not.

<sup>35</sup> Once I have sworn by My holiness, I lie not to David,

<sup>36</sup> His seed is to the age, And his throne [is] as the sun before Me,

<sup>37</sup> As the moon it is established — to the age, And the witness in the sky is stedfast. Selah.

<sup>38</sup> And Thou, Thou hast cast off, and dost reject, Thou hast shown Thyself wroth With Thine anointed,

<sup>39</sup> Hast rejected the covenant of Thy servant, Thou hast polluted to the earth his crown,

<sup>40</sup> Thou hast broken down all his hedges, Thou hast made his fenced places a ruin.

<sup>41</sup> Spoiled him have all passing by the way, He hath been a reproach to his neighbours,

<sup>42</sup> Thou hast exalted the right hand of his adversaries, Thou hast caused all his enemies to rejoice.

<sup>43</sup> Also — Thou turnest back the sharpness of his sword, And hast not established him in battle,

<sup>44</sup> Hast caused [him] to cease from his brightness, And his throne to the earth hast cast down.

<sup>45</sup> Thou hast shortened the days of his youth, Hast covered him over [with] shame. Selah.

<sup>46</sup> Till when, O Jehovah, art Thou hidden? For ever doth Thy fury burn as fire?

<sup>47</sup> Remember, I pray Thee, what [is] life-time? Wherefore in vain hast Thou created All the sons of men?

<sup>48</sup> Who [is] the man that liveth, and doth not see death? He delivereth his soul from the hand of Sheol. Selah.

<sup>49</sup> Where [are] Thy former kindnesses, O Lord. Thou hast sworn to David in Thy faithfulness,

<sup>50</sup> Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Thy servants, I have borne in my bosom all the strivings of the peoples,

<sup>51</sup> Wherewith Thine enemies reproached, O Jehovah, Wherewith they have reproached The steps of Thine anointed.

<sup>52</sup> Blessed [is] Jehovah to the age. Amen, and amen!
