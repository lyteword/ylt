# Psalm 54

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer with stringed instruments. — An instruction, by David, in the coming in of the Ziphim, and they say to Saul, 'Is not David hiding himself with us?' O God, by Thy name save me, and by Thy might judge me.

<sup>2</sup> O God, hear my prayer, Give ear to the sayings of my mouth,

<sup>3</sup> For strangers have risen up against me And terrible ones have sought my soul, They have not set God before them. Selah.

<sup>4</sup> Lo, God [is] a helper to me, The Lord [is] with those supporting my soul,

<sup>5</sup> Turn back doth the evil thing to mine enemies, In Thy truth cut them off.

<sup>6</sup> With a free will-offering I sacrifice to Thee, I thank Thy name, O Jehovah, for [it is] good,

<sup>7</sup> For, from all adversity He delivered me, And on mine enemies hath mine eye looked!
