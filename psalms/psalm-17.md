# Psalm 17

<sup>1</sup> A Prayer of David. Hear, O Jehovah, righteousness, attend my cry, Give ear [to] my prayer, without lips of deceit.

<sup>2</sup> From before thee my judgment doth go out; Thine eyes do see uprightly.

<sup>3</sup> Thou hast proved my heart, Thou hast inspected by night, Thou hast tried me, Thou findest nothing; My thoughts pass not over my mouth.

<sup>4</sup> As to doings of man, Through a word of Thy lips I have observed The paths of a destroyer;

<sup>5</sup> To uphold my goings in Thy paths, My steps have not slidden.

<sup>6</sup> I — I called Thee, for Thou dost answer me, O God, incline Thine ear to me, hear my speech.

<sup>7</sup> Separate wonderfully Thy kindness, O Saviour of the confiding, By Thy right hand, from withstanders.

<sup>8</sup> Keep me as the apple, the daughter of the eye; In shadow of Thy wings thou dost hide me.

<sup>9</sup> From the face of the wicked who spoiled me. Mine enemies in soul go round against me.

<sup>10</sup> Their fat they have closed up, Their mouths have spoken with pride:

<sup>11</sup> 'Our steps now have compassed [him];' Their eyes they set to turn aside in the land.

<sup>12</sup> His likeness as a lion desirous to tear, As a young lion dwelling in secret places.

<sup>13</sup> Arise, O Jehovah, go before his face, Cause him to bend. Deliver my soul from the wicked, Thy sword,

<sup>14</sup> From men, Thy hand, O Jehovah, From men of the world, their portion [is] in life, And [with] Thy hidden things Thou fillest their belly, They are satisfied [with] sons; And have left their abundance to their sucklings.

<sup>15</sup> I — in righteousness, I see Thy face; I am satisfied, in awaking, [with] Thy form!
