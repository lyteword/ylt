# Psalm 39

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer, to Jeduthun. — A Psalm of David. I have said, 'I observe my ways, Against sinning with my tongue, I keep for my mouth a curb, while the wicked [is] before me.'

<sup>2</sup> I was dumb [with] silence, I kept silent from good, and my pain is excited.

<sup>3</sup> Hot [is] my heart within me, In my meditating doth the fire burn, I have spoken with my tongue.

<sup>4</sup> 'Cause me to know, O Jehovah, mine end, And the measure of my days — what it [is],' I know how frail I [am].

<sup>5</sup> Lo, handbreadths Thou hast made my days, And mine age [is] as nothing before Thee, Only, all vanity [is] every man set up. Selah.

<sup>6</sup> Only, in an image doth each walk habitually, Only, [in] vain, they are disquieted, He heapeth up and knoweth not who gathereth them.

<sup>7</sup> And, now, what have I expected? O Lord, my hope — it [is] of Thee.

<sup>8</sup> From all my transgressions deliver me, A reproach of the fool make me not.

<sup>9</sup> I have been dumb, I open not my mouth, Because Thou — Thou hast done [it].

<sup>10</sup> Turn aside from off me Thy stroke, From the striving of Thy hand I have been consumed.

<sup>11</sup> With reproofs against iniquity, Thou hast corrected man, And dost waste as a moth his desirableness, Only, vanity [is] every man. Selah.

<sup>12</sup> Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, And [to] my cry give ear, Unto my tear be not silent, For a sojourner I [am] with Thee, A settler like all my fathers.

<sup>13</sup> Look from me, and I brighten up before I go and am not!
