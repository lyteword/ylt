# Psalm 102

<sup>1</sup> A Prayer of the afflicted when he is feeble, and before Jehovah poureth out his plaint. O Jehovah, hear my prayer, yea, my cry to Thee cometh.

<sup>2</sup> Hide not Thou Thy face from me, In a day of mine adversity, Incline unto me Thine ear, In the day I call, haste, answer me.

<sup>3</sup> For consumed in smoke have been my days, And my bones as a fire-brand have burned.

<sup>4</sup> Smitten as the herb, and withered, is my heart, For I have forgotten to eat my bread.

<sup>5</sup> From the voice of my sighing Hath my bone cleaved to my flesh.

<sup>6</sup> I have been like to a pelican of the wilderness, I have been as an owl of the dry places.

<sup>7</sup> I have watched, and I am As a bird alone on the roof.

<sup>8</sup> All the day mine enemies reproached me, Those mad at me have sworn against me.

<sup>9</sup> Because ashes as bread I have eaten, And my drink with weeping have mingled,

<sup>10</sup> From Thine indignation and Thy wrath, For Thou hast lifted me up, And dost cast me down.

<sup>11</sup> My days as a shadow [are] stretched out, And I — as the herb I am withered.

<sup>12</sup> And Thou, O Jehovah, to the age abidest, And Thy memorial to all generations.

<sup>13</sup> Thou — Thou risest — Thou pitiest Zion, For the time to favour her, For the appointed time hath come.

<sup>14</sup> For Thy servants have been pleased with her stones, And her dust they favour.

<sup>15</sup> And nations fear the name of Jehovah, And all kings of the earth Thine honour,

<sup>16</sup> For Jehovah hath builded Zion, He hath been seen in His honour,

<sup>17</sup> He turned unto the prayer of the destitute, And He hath not despised their prayer.

<sup>18</sup> This is written for a later generation, And the people created do praise Jah.

<sup>19</sup> For He hath looked From the high place of His sanctuary. Jehovah from heaven unto earth looked attentively,

<sup>20</sup> To hear the groan of the prisoner, To loose sons of death,

<sup>21</sup> To declare in Zion the name of Jehovah, And His praise in Jerusalem,

<sup>22</sup> In the peoples being gathered together, And the kingdoms — to serve Jehovah.

<sup>23</sup> He hath humbled in the way my power, He hath shortened my days.

<sup>24</sup> I say, 'My God, take me not up in the midst of my days,' Through all generations [are] Thine years.

<sup>25</sup> Beforetime the earth Thou didst found, And the work of Thy hands [are] the heavens.

<sup>26</sup> They — They perish, and Thou remainest, And all of them as a garment become old, As clothing Thou changest them, And they are changed.

<sup>27</sup> And Thou [art] the same, and Thine years are not finished.

<sup>28</sup> The sons of Thy servants do continue, And their seed before Thee is established!
