# Psalm 102 

**¹** A Prayer of the afflicted when he is feeble, and before Jehovah poureth out his plaint. O Jehovah, hear my prayer, yea, my cry to Thee cometh.

**²** Hide not Thou Thy face from me, In a day of mine adversity, Incline unto me Thine ear, In the day I call, haste, answer me.

**³** For consumed in smoke have been my days, And my bones as a fire-brand have burned.

**⁴** Smitten as the herb, and withered, is my heart, For I have forgotten to eat my bread.

**⁵** From the voice of my sighing Hath my bone cleaved to my flesh.

**⁶** I have been like to a pelican of the wilderness, I have been as an owl of the dry places.

**⁷** I have watched, and I am As a bird alone on the roof.

**⁸** All the day mine enemies reproached me, Those mad at me have sworn against me.

**⁹** Because ashes as bread I have eaten, And my drink with weeping have mingled,

**¹⁰** From Thine indignation and Thy wrath, For Thou hast lifted me up, And dost cast me down.

**¹¹** My days as a shadow [are] stretched out, And I — as the herb I am withered.

**¹²** And Thou, O Jehovah, to the age abidest, And Thy memorial to all generations.

**¹³** Thou — Thou risest — Thou pitiest Zion, For the time to favour her, For the appointed time hath come.

**¹⁴** For Thy servants have been pleased with her stones, And her dust they favour.

**¹⁵** And nations fear the name of Jehovah, And all kings of the earth Thine honour,

**¹⁶** For Jehovah hath builded Zion, He hath been seen in His honour,

**¹⁷** He turned unto the prayer of the destitute, And He hath not despised their prayer.

**¹⁸** This is written for a later generation, And the people created do praise Jah.

**¹⁹** For He hath looked From the high place of His sanctuary. Jehovah from heaven unto earth looked attentively,

**²⁰** To hear the groan of the prisoner, To loose sons of death,

**²¹** To declare in Zion the name of Jehovah, And His praise in Jerusalem,

**²²** In the peoples being gathered together, And the kingdoms — to serve Jehovah.

**²³** He hath humbled in the way my power, He hath shortened my days.

**²⁴** I say, 'My God, take me not up in the midst of my days,' Through all generations [are] Thine years.

**²⁵** Beforetime the earth Thou didst found, And the work of Thy hands [are] the heavens.

**²⁶** They — They perish, and Thou remainest, And all of them as a garment become old, As clothing Thou changest them, And they are changed.

**²⁷** And Thou [art] the same, and Thine years are not finished.

**²⁸** The sons of Thy servants do continue, And their seed before Thee is established!
