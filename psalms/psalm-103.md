# Psalm 103

<sup>1</sup> By David. Bless, O my soul, Jehovah, And all my inward parts — His Holy Name.

<sup>2</sup> Bless, O my soul, Jehovah, And forget not all His benefits,

<sup>3</sup> Who is forgiving all thine iniquities, Who is healing all thy diseases,

<sup>4</sup> Who is redeeming from destruction thy life, Who is crowning thee — kindness and mercies,

<sup>5</sup> Who is satisfying with good thy desire, Renew itself as an eagle doth thy youth.

<sup>6</sup> Jehovah is doing righteousness and judgments For all the oppressed.

<sup>7</sup> He maketh known His ways to Moses, To the sons of Israel His acts.

<sup>8</sup> Merciful and gracious [is] Jehovah, Slow to anger, and abundant in mercy.

<sup>9</sup> Not for ever doth He strive, Nor to the age doth He watch.

<sup>10</sup> Not according to our sins hath He done to us, Nor according to our iniquities Hath He conferred benefits upon us.

<sup>11</sup> For, as the height of the heavens [is] above the earth, His kindness hath been mighty over those fearing Him.

<sup>12</sup> As the distance of east from west He hath put far from us our transgressions.

<sup>13</sup> As a father hath mercy on sons, Jehovah hath mercy on those fearing Him.

<sup>14</sup> For He hath known our frame, Remembering that we [are] dust.

<sup>15</sup> Mortal man! as grass [are] his days, As a flower of the field so he flourisheth;

<sup>16</sup> For a wind hath passed over it, and it is not, And its place doth not discern it any more.

<sup>17</sup> And the kindness of Jehovah [Is] from age even unto age on those fearing Him, And His righteousness to sons' sons,

<sup>18</sup> To those keeping His covenant, And to those remembering His precepts to do them.

<sup>19</sup> Jehovah in the heavens Hath established His throne, And His kingdom over all hath ruled.

<sup>20</sup> Bless Jehovah, ye His messengers, Mighty in power — doing His word, To hearken to the voice of His Word.

<sup>21</sup> Bless Jehovah, all ye His hosts, His ministers — doing His pleasure.

<sup>22</sup> Bless Jehovah, all ye His works, In all places of His dominion. Bless, O my soul, Jehovah!
