# Psalm 103

**¹** By David. Bless, O my soul, Jehovah, And all my inward parts — His Holy Name.

**²** Bless, O my soul, Jehovah, And forget not all His benefits,

**³** Who is forgiving all thine iniquities, Who is healing all thy diseases,

**⁴** Who is redeeming from destruction thy life, Who is crowning thee — kindness and mercies,

**⁵** Who is satisfying with good thy desire, Renew itself as an eagle doth thy youth.

**⁶** Jehovah is doing righteousness and judgments For all the oppressed.

**⁷** He maketh known His ways to Moses, To the sons of Israel His acts.

**⁸** Merciful and gracious [is] Jehovah, Slow to anger, and abundant in mercy.

**⁹** Not for ever doth He strive, Nor to the age doth He watch.

**¹⁰** Not according to our sins hath He done to us, Nor according to our iniquities Hath He conferred benefits upon us.

**¹¹** For, as the height of the heavens [is] above the earth, His kindness hath been mighty over those fearing Him.

**¹²** As the distance of east from west He hath put far from us our transgressions.

**¹³** As a father hath mercy on sons, Jehovah hath mercy on those fearing Him.

**¹⁴** For He hath known our frame, Remembering that we [are] dust.

**¹⁵** Mortal man! as grass [are] his days, As a flower of the field so he flourisheth;

**¹⁶** For a wind hath passed over it, and it is not, And its place doth not discern it any more.

**¹⁷** And the kindness of Jehovah [Is] from age even unto age on those fearing Him, And His righteousness to sons' sons,

**¹⁸** To those keeping His covenant, And to those remembering His precepts to do them.

**¹⁹** Jehovah in the heavens Hath established His throne, And His kingdom over all hath ruled.

**²⁰** Bless Jehovah, ye His messengers, Mighty in power — doing His word, To hearken to the voice of His Word.

**²¹** Bless Jehovah, all ye His hosts, His ministers — doing His pleasure.

**²²** Bless Jehovah, all ye His works, In all places of His dominion. Bless, O my soul, Jehovah!
