# Psalm 11 

**¹** To the Overseer. — By David. In Jehovah I trusted, how say ye to my soul, 'They moved [to] Thy mountain for the bird?

**²** For lo, the wicked tread a bow, They have prepared their arrow on the string, To shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.

**³** When the foundations are destroyed, The righteous — what hath he done?

**⁴** 'Jehovah [is] in his holy temple: Jehovah — in the heavens [is] His throne. His eyes see — His eyelids try the sons of men.

**⁵** Jehovah the righteous doth try. And the wicked and the lover of violence, Hath His soul hated,

**⁶** He poureth on the wicked snares, fire, and brimstone, And a horrible wind [is] the portion of their cup.

**⁷** For righteous [is] Jehovah, Righteousness He hath loved, The upright doth His countenance see!'
