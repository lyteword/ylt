# Psalm 74

<sup>1</sup> An Instruction of Asaph. Why, O God, hast Thou cast off for ever? Thine anger smoketh against the flock of Thy pasture.

<sup>2</sup> Remember Thy company. Thou didst purchase of old, Thou didst redeem the rod of Thy inheritance, This mount Zion — Thou didst dwell in it.

<sup>3</sup> Lift up Thy steps to the perpetual desolations, Everything the enemy did wickedly in the sanctuary.

<sup>4</sup> Roared have thine adversaries, In the midst of Thy meeting-places, They have set their ensigns as ensigns.

<sup>5</sup> He is known as one bringing in on high Against a thicket of wood — axes.

<sup>6</sup> And now, its carvings together With axe and hatchet they break down,

<sup>7</sup> They have sent into fire Thy sanctuary, to the earth they polluted the tabernacle of Thy name,

<sup>8</sup> They said in their hearts, 'Let us oppress them together,' They did burn all the meeting-places of God in the land.

<sup>9</sup> Our ensigns we have not seen, There is no more a prophet, Nor with us is one knowing how long.

<sup>10</sup> Till when, O God, doth an adversary reproach? Doth an enemy despise thy name for ever?

<sup>11</sup> Why dost Thou turn back Thy hand, Even Thy right hand? From the midst of Thy bosom remove [it].

<sup>12</sup> And God [is] my king of old, Working salvation in the midst of the earth.

<sup>13</sup> Thou hast broken by Thy strength a sea -[monster], Thou hast shivered Heads of dragons by the waters,

<sup>14</sup> Thou hast broken the heads of leviathan, Thou makest him food, For the people of the dry places.

<sup>15</sup> Thou hast cleaved a fountain and a stream, Thou hast dried up perennial flowings.

<sup>16</sup> Thine [is] the day, also Thine [is] the night, Thou hast prepared a light giver — the sun.

<sup>17</sup> Thou hast set up all the borders of earth, Summer and winter Thou hast formed them.

<sup>18</sup> Remember this — an enemy reproached Jehovah, And a foolish people have despised Thy name.

<sup>19</sup> Give not up to a company, The soul of Thy turtle-dove, The company of Thy poor ones forget not for ever.

<sup>20</sup> Look attentively to the covenant, For the dark places of earth, Have been full of habitations of violence.

<sup>21</sup> Let not the oppressed turn back ashamed, Let the poor and needy praise Thy name,

<sup>22</sup> Arise, O God, plead Thy plea, Remember Thy reproach from a fool all the day.

<sup>23</sup> Forget not the voice of Thine adversaries, The noise of Thy withstanders is going up continually!
