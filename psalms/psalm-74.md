# Psalm 74

**¹** An Instruction of Asaph. Why, O God, hast Thou cast off for ever? Thine anger smoketh against the flock of Thy pasture.

**²** Remember Thy company. Thou didst purchase of old, Thou didst redeem the rod of Thy inheritance, This mount Zion — Thou didst dwell in it.

**³** Lift up Thy steps to the perpetual desolations, Everything the enemy did wickedly in the sanctuary.

**⁴** Roared have thine adversaries, In the midst of Thy meeting-places, They have set their ensigns as ensigns.

**⁵** He is known as one bringing in on high Against a thicket of wood — axes.

**⁶** And now, its carvings together With axe and hatchet they break down,

**⁷** They have sent into fire Thy sanctuary, to the earth they polluted the tabernacle of Thy name,

**⁸** They said in their hearts, 'Let us oppress them together,' They did burn all the meeting-places of God in the land.

**⁹** Our ensigns we have not seen, There is no more a prophet, Nor with us is one knowing how long.

**¹⁰** Till when, O God, doth an adversary reproach? Doth an enemy despise thy name for ever?

**¹¹** Why dost Thou turn back Thy hand, Even Thy right hand? From the midst of Thy bosom remove [it].

**¹²** And God [is] my king of old, Working salvation in the midst of the earth.

**¹³** Thou hast broken by Thy strength a sea -[monster], Thou hast shivered Heads of dragons by the waters,

**¹⁴** Thou hast broken the heads of leviathan, Thou makest him food, For the people of the dry places.

**¹⁵** Thou hast cleaved a fountain and a stream, Thou hast dried up perennial flowings.

**¹⁶** Thine [is] the day, also Thine [is] the night, Thou hast prepared a light giver — the sun.

**¹⁷** Thou hast set up all the borders of earth, Summer and winter Thou hast formed them.

**¹⁸** Remember this — an enemy reproached Jehovah, And a foolish people have despised Thy name.

**¹⁹** Give not up to a company, The soul of Thy turtle-dove, The company of Thy poor ones forget not for ever.

**²⁰** Look attentively to the covenant, For the dark places of earth, Have been full of habitations of violence.

**²¹** Let not the oppressed turn back ashamed, Let the poor and needy praise Thy name,

**²²** Arise, O God, plead Thy plea, Remember Thy reproach from a fool all the day.

**²³** Forget not the voice of Thine adversaries, The noise of Thy withstanders is going up continually!
