# Psalm 35 

**¹** By David. Strive, Jehovah, with my strivers, fight with my fighters,

**²** Take hold of shield and buckler, and rise for my help,

**³** And draw out spear and lance, To meet my pursuers. Say to my soul, 'Thy salvation I [am].'

**⁴** They are ashamed and blush, those seeking my soul, Turned backward and confounded, Those devising my evil.

**⁵** They are as chaff before wind, And a messenger of Jehovah driving away.

**⁶** Their way is darkness and slipperiness, And a messenger of Jehovah their pursuer.

**⁷** For without cause they hid for me their netpit, Without cause they digged for my soul.

**⁸** Meet him doth desolation — he knoweth not, And his net that he hid catcheth him, For desolation he falleth into it.

**⁹** And my soul is joyful in Jehovah, It rejoiceth in His salvation.

**¹⁰** All my bones say, 'Jehovah, who is like Thee, Delivering the poor from the stronger than he, And the poor and needy from his plunderer.'

**¹¹** Violent witnesses rise up, That which I have not known they ask me.

**¹²** They pay me evil for good, bereaving my soul,

**¹³** And I — in their sickness my clothing [is] sackcloth, I have humbled with fastings my soul, And my prayer unto my bosom returneth.

**¹⁴** As [if] a friend, as [if] my brother, I walked habitually, As a mourner for a mother, Mourning I have bowed down.

**¹⁵** And — in my halting they have rejoiced, And have been gathered together, Gathered against me were the smiters, And I have not known, They have rent, and they have not ceased;

**¹⁶** With profane ones, mockers in feasts, Gnashing against me their teeth.

**¹⁷** Lord, how long dost thou behold? Keep back my soul from their desolations, From young lions my only one.

**¹⁸** I thank Thee in a great assembly, Among a mighty people I praise Thee.

**¹⁹** Mine enemies rejoice not over me [with] falsehood, Those hating me without cause wink the eye.

**²⁰** For they speak not peace, And against the quiet of the land, Deceitful words they devise,

**²¹** And they enlarge against me their mouth, They said, 'Aha, aha, our eye hath seen.'

**²²** Thou hast seen, O Jehovah, Be not silent, O Lord — be not far from me,

**²³** Stir up, and wake to my judgment, My God, and my Lord, to my plea.

**²⁴** Judge me according to Thy righteousness, O Jehovah my God, And they do not rejoice over me.

**²⁵** They do not say in their heart, 'Aha, our desire.' They do not say, 'We swallowed him up.'

**²⁶** They are ashamed and confounded together, Who are rejoicing at my evil. They put on shame and confusion, Who are magnifying themselves against me.

**²⁷** They sing and rejoice, who are desiring my righteousness, And they say continually, 'Jehovah is magnified, Who is desiring the peace of His servant.'

**²⁸** And my tongue uttereth Thy righteousness, All the day Thy praise!
