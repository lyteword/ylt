# Psalm 35

<sup>1</sup> By David. Strive, Jehovah, with my strivers, fight with my fighters,

<sup>2</sup> Take hold of shield and buckler, and rise for my help,

<sup>3</sup> And draw out spear and lance, To meet my pursuers. Say to my soul, 'Thy salvation I [am].'

<sup>4</sup> They are ashamed and blush, those seeking my soul, Turned backward and confounded, Those devising my evil.

<sup>5</sup> They are as chaff before wind, And a messenger of Jehovah driving away.

<sup>6</sup> Their way is darkness and slipperiness, And a messenger of Jehovah their pursuer.

<sup>7</sup> For without cause they hid for me their netpit, Without cause they digged for my soul.

<sup>8</sup> Meet him doth desolation — he knoweth not, And his net that he hid catcheth him, For desolation he falleth into it.

<sup>9</sup> And my soul is joyful in Jehovah, It rejoiceth in His salvation.

<sup>10</sup> All my bones say, 'Jehovah, who is like Thee, Delivering the poor from the stronger than he, And the poor and needy from his plunderer.'

<sup>11</sup> Violent witnesses rise up, That which I have not known they ask me.

<sup>12</sup> They pay me evil for good, bereaving my soul,

<sup>13</sup> And I — in their sickness my clothing [is] sackcloth, I have humbled with fastings my soul, And my prayer unto my bosom returneth.

<sup>14</sup> As [if] a friend, as [if] my brother, I walked habitually, As a mourner for a mother, Mourning I have bowed down.

<sup>15</sup> And — in my halting they have rejoiced, And have been gathered together, Gathered against me were the smiters, And I have not known, They have rent, and they have not ceased;

<sup>16</sup> With profane ones, mockers in feasts, Gnashing against me their teeth.

<sup>17</sup> Lord, how long dost thou behold? Keep back my soul from their desolations, From young lions my only one.

<sup>18</sup> I thank Thee in a great assembly, Among a mighty people I praise Thee.

<sup>19</sup> Mine enemies rejoice not over me [with] falsehood, Those hating me without cause wink the eye.

<sup>20</sup> For they speak not peace, And against the quiet of the land, Deceitful words they devise,

<sup>21</sup> And they enlarge against me their mouth, They said, 'Aha, aha, our eye hath seen.'

<sup>22</sup> Thou hast seen, O Jehovah, Be not silent, O Lord — be not far from me,

<sup>23</sup> Stir up, and wake to my judgment, My God, and my Lord, to my plea.

<sup>24</sup> Judge me according to Thy righteousness, O Jehovah my God, And they do not rejoice over me.

<sup>25</sup> They do not say in their heart, 'Aha, our desire.' They do not say, 'We swallowed him up.'

<sup>26</sup> They are ashamed and confounded together, Who are rejoicing at my evil. They put on shame and confusion, Who are magnifying themselves against me.

<sup>27</sup> They sing and rejoice, who are desiring my righteousness, And they say continually, 'Jehovah is magnified, Who is desiring the peace of His servant.'

<sup>28</sup> And my tongue uttereth Thy righteousness, All the day Thy praise!
