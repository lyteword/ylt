# Psalm 82

<sup>1</sup> — A Psalm of Asaph. God hath stood in the company of God, In the midst God doth judge.

<sup>2</sup> Till when do ye judge perversely? And the face of the wicked lift up? Selah.

<sup>3</sup> Judge ye the weak and fatherless, The afflicted and the poor declare righteous.

<sup>4</sup> Let the weak and needy escape, From the hand of the wicked deliver them.

<sup>5</sup> They knew not, nor do they understand, In darkness they walk habitually, Moved are all the foundations of earth.

<sup>6</sup> I — I have said, 'Gods ye [are], And sons of the Most High — all of you,

<sup>7</sup> But as man ye die, and as one of the heads ye fall,

<sup>8</sup> Rise, O God, judge the earth, For Thou hast inheritance among all the nations!
