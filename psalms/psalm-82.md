# Psalm 82

**¹** — A Psalm of Asaph. God hath stood in the company of God, In the midst God doth judge.

**²** Till when do ye judge perversely? And the face of the wicked lift up? Selah.

**³** Judge ye the weak and fatherless, The afflicted and the poor declare righteous.

**⁴** Let the weak and needy escape, From the hand of the wicked deliver them.

**⁵** They knew not, nor do they understand, In darkness they walk habitually, Moved are all the foundations of earth.

**⁶** I — I have said, 'Gods ye [are], And sons of the Most High — all of you,

**⁷** But as man ye die, and as one of the heads ye fall,

**⁸** Rise, O God, judge the earth, For Thou hast inheritance among all the nations!
