# Psalm 58 

**¹** To the Overseer. — 'Destroy not.' — A secret treasure, by David. Is it true, O dumb one, righteously ye speak? Uprightly ye judge, O sons of men?

**²** Even in heart ye work iniquities, In the land the violence of your hands ye ponder.

**³** The wicked have been estranged from the womb, They have erred from the belly, speaking lies.

**⁴** Their poison [is] as poison of a serpent, As a deaf asp shutting its ear,

**⁵** Which hearkeneth not to the voice of whisperers, A charmer of charms most skilful.

**⁶** O God, break their teeth in their mouth, The jaw-teeth of young lions break down, O Jehovah.

**⁷** They are melted as waters, They go up and down for themselves, His arrow proceedeth as they cut themselves off.

**⁸** As a snail that melteth he goeth on, [As] an untimely birth of a woman, They have not seen the sun.

**⁹** Before your pots discern the bramble, As well the raw as the heated He whirleth away.

**¹⁰** The righteous rejoiceth that he hath seen vengeance, His steps he washeth in the blood of the wicked.

**¹¹** And man saith: 'Surely fruit [is] for the righteous: Surely there is a God judging in the earth!'
