# Psalm 145

<sup>1</sup> Praise by David. I exalt Thee, my God, O king, And bless Thy name to the age and for ever.

<sup>2</sup> Every day do I bless Thee, And praise Thy name to the age and for ever.

<sup>3</sup> Great [is] Jehovah, and praised greatly, And of His greatness there is no searching.

<sup>4</sup> Generation to generation praiseth Thy works, And Thy mighty acts they declare.

<sup>5</sup> The honour — the glory of Thy majesty, And the matters of Thy wonders I declare.

<sup>6</sup> And the strength of Thy fearful acts they tell, And Thy greatness I recount.

<sup>7</sup> The memorial of the abundance of Thy goodness they send forth. And Thy righteousness they sing.

<sup>8</sup> Gracious and merciful [is] Jehovah, Slow to anger, and great in kindness.

<sup>9</sup> Good [is] Jehovah to all, And His mercies [are] over all His works.

<sup>10</sup> Confess Thee O Jehovah, do all Thy works, And Thy saints do bless Thee.

<sup>11</sup> The honour of Thy kingdom they tell, And [of] Thy might they speak,

<sup>12</sup> To make known to sons of men His mighty acts, The honour of the majesty of His kingdom.

<sup>13</sup> Thy kingdom [is] a kingdom of all ages, And Thy dominion [is] in all generations.

<sup>14</sup> Jehovah is supporting all who are falling, And raising up all who are bowed down.

<sup>15</sup> The eyes of all unto Thee do look, And Thou art giving to them their food in its season,

<sup>16</sup> Opening Thy hand, and satisfying The desire of every living thing.

<sup>17</sup> Righteous [is] Jehovah in all His ways, And kind in all His works.

<sup>18</sup> Near [is] Jehovah to all those calling Him, To all who call Him in truth.

<sup>19</sup> The desire of those fearing Him He doth, And their cry He heareth, and saveth them.

<sup>20</sup> Jehovah preserveth all those loving Him, And all the wicked He destroyeth.

<sup>21</sup> The praise of Jehovah my mouth speaketh, And all flesh doth bless His holy name, To the age and for ever!
