# Psalm 145

**¹** Praise by David. I exalt Thee, my God, O king, And bless Thy name to the age and for ever.

**²** Every day do I bless Thee, And praise Thy name to the age and for ever.

**³** Great [is] Jehovah, and praised greatly, And of His greatness there is no searching.

**⁴** Generation to generation praiseth Thy works, And Thy mighty acts they declare.

**⁵** The honour — the glory of Thy majesty, And the matters of Thy wonders I declare.

**⁶** And the strength of Thy fearful acts they tell, And Thy greatness I recount.

**⁷** The memorial of the abundance of Thy goodness they send forth. And Thy righteousness they sing.

**⁸** Gracious and merciful [is] Jehovah, Slow to anger, and great in kindness.

**⁹** Good [is] Jehovah to all, And His mercies [are] over all His works.

**¹⁰** Confess Thee O Jehovah, do all Thy works, And Thy saints do bless Thee.

**¹¹** The honour of Thy kingdom they tell, And [of] Thy might they speak,

**¹²** To make known to sons of men His mighty acts, The honour of the majesty of His kingdom.

**¹³** Thy kingdom [is] a kingdom of all ages, And Thy dominion [is] in all generations.

**¹⁴** Jehovah is supporting all who are falling, And raising up all who are bowed down.

**¹⁵** The eyes of all unto Thee do look, And Thou art giving to them their food in its season,

**¹⁶** Opening Thy hand, and satisfying The desire of every living thing.

**¹⁷** Righteous [is] Jehovah in all His ways, And kind in all His works.

**¹⁸** Near [is] Jehovah to all those calling Him, To all who call Him in truth.

**¹⁹** The desire of those fearing Him He doth, And their cry He heareth, and saveth them.

**²⁰** Jehovah preserveth all those loving Him, And all the wicked He destroyeth.

**²¹** The praise of Jehovah my mouth speaketh, And all flesh doth bless His holy name, To the age and for ever!
