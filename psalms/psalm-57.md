# Psalm 57

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer. — 'Destroy not.' — A secret treasure of David, in his fleeing from the face of Saul into a cave. Favour me, O God, favour me, For in Thee is my soul trusting, And in the shadow of Thy wings I trust, Until the calamities pass over.

<sup>2</sup> I call to God Most High, To God [who] is perfecting for me.

<sup>3</sup> He sendeth from the heaven, and saveth me, He reproached — who is panting after me. Selah. God sendeth forth His kindness and His truth.

<sup>4</sup> My soul [is] in the midst of lions, I lie down [among] flames — sons of men, Their teeth [are] a spear and arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword.

<sup>5</sup> Be Thou exalted above the heavens, O God, Above all the earth Thine honour.

<sup>6</sup> A net they have prepared for my steps, Bowed down hath my soul, They have digged before me a pit, They have fallen into its midst. Selah.

<sup>7</sup> Prepared is my heart, O God, Prepared is my heart, I sing and praise.

<sup>8</sup> Awake, mine honour, awake, psaltery and harp, I awake the morning dawn.

<sup>9</sup> I thank Thee among the peoples, O Lord, I praise Thee among the nations.

<sup>10</sup> For great unto the heavens [is] Thy kindness, And unto the clouds Thy truth.

<sup>11</sup> Be thou exalted above the heavens, O God. Above all the earth Thine honour!
