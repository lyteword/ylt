# Psalm 26

<sup>1</sup> By David. Judge me, O Jehovah, for I in mine integrity have walked, And in Jehovah I have trusted, I slide not.

<sup>2</sup> Try me, O Jehovah, and prove me, Purified [are] my reins and my heart.

<sup>3</sup> For Thy kindness [is] before mine eyes, And I have walked habitually in Thy truth.

<sup>4</sup> I have not sat with vain men, And with dissemblers I enter not.

<sup>5</sup> I have hated the assembly of evil doers, And with the wicked I sit not.

<sup>6</sup> I wash in innocency my hands, And I compass Thine altar, O Jehovah.

<sup>7</sup> To sound with a voice of confession, And to recount all Thy wonders.

<sup>8</sup> Jehovah, I have loved the habitation of Thy house, And the place of the tabernacle of Thine honour.

<sup>9</sup> Do not gather with sinners my soul, And with men of blood my life,

<sup>10</sup> In whose hand [is] a wicked device, And their right hand [is] full of bribes.

<sup>11</sup> And I, in mine integrity I walk, Redeem me, and favour me.

<sup>12</sup> My foot hath stood in uprightness, In assemblies I bless Jehovah!
