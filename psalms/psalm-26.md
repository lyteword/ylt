# Psalm 26 

**¹** By David. Judge me, O Jehovah, for I in mine integrity have walked, And in Jehovah I have trusted, I slide not.

**²** Try me, O Jehovah, and prove me, Purified [are] my reins and my heart.

**³** For Thy kindness [is] before mine eyes, And I have walked habitually in Thy truth.

**⁴** I have not sat with vain men, And with dissemblers I enter not.

**⁵** I have hated the assembly of evil doers, And with the wicked I sit not.

**⁶** I wash in innocency my hands, And I compass Thine altar, O Jehovah.

**⁷** To sound with a voice of confession, And to recount all Thy wonders.

**⁸** Jehovah, I have loved the habitation of Thy house, And the place of the tabernacle of Thine honour.

**⁹** Do not gather with sinners my soul, And with men of blood my life,

**¹⁰** In whose hand [is] a wicked device, And their right hand [is] full of bribes.

**¹¹** And I, in mine integrity I walk, Redeem me, and favour me.

**¹²** My foot hath stood in uprightness, In assemblies I bless Jehovah!
