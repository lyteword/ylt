# Psalm 29

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. Ascribe to Jehovah, ye sons of the mighty, Ascribe to Jehovah honour and strength.

<sup>2</sup> Ascribe to Jehovah the honour of His name, Bow yourselves to Jehovah, In the beauty of holiness.

<sup>3</sup> The voice of Jehovah [is] on the waters, The God of glory hath thundered, Jehovah [is] on many waters.

<sup>4</sup> The voice of Jehovah [is] with power, The voice of Jehovah [is] with majesty,

<sup>5</sup> The voice of Jehovah [is] shivering cedars, Yea, Jehovah shivers the cedars of Lebanon.

<sup>6</sup> And He causeth them to skip as a calf, Lebanon and Sirion as a son of Reems,

<sup>7</sup> The voice of Jehovah is hewing fiery flames,

<sup>8</sup> The voice of Jehovah paineth a wilderness, Jehovah paineth the wilderness of Kadesh.

<sup>9</sup> The voice of Jehovah paineth the oaks, And maketh bare the forests, And in His temple every one saith, 'Glory.'

<sup>10</sup> Jehovah on the deluge hath sat, And Jehovah sitteth king — to the age,

<sup>11</sup> Jehovah strength to his people giveth, Jehovah blesseth His people with peace!
