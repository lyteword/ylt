# Psalm 29

**¹** A Psalm of David. Ascribe to Jehovah, ye sons of the mighty, Ascribe to Jehovah honour and strength.

**²** Ascribe to Jehovah the honour of His name, Bow yourselves to Jehovah, In the beauty of holiness.

**³** The voice of Jehovah [is] on the waters, The God of glory hath thundered, Jehovah [is] on many waters.

**⁴** The voice of Jehovah [is] with power, The voice of Jehovah [is] with majesty,

**⁵** The voice of Jehovah [is] shivering cedars, Yea, Jehovah shivers the cedars of Lebanon.

**⁶** And He causeth them to skip as a calf, Lebanon and Sirion as a son of Reems,

**⁷** The voice of Jehovah is hewing fiery flames,

**⁸** The voice of Jehovah paineth a wilderness, Jehovah paineth the wilderness of Kadesh.

**⁹** The voice of Jehovah paineth the oaks, And maketh bare the forests, And in His temple every one saith, 'Glory.'

**¹⁰** Jehovah on the deluge hath sat, And Jehovah sitteth king — to the age,

**¹¹** Jehovah strength to his people giveth, Jehovah blesseth His people with peace!
