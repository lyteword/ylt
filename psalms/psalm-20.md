# Psalm 20

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer. — A Psalm of David. Jehovah doth answer thee, In a day of adversity, The name of the God of Jacob doth set thee on high,

<sup>2</sup> He doth send thy help from the sanctuary, And from Zion doth support thee,

<sup>3</sup> He doth remember all thy presents, And thy burnt-offering doth reduce to ashes. Selah.

<sup>4</sup> He doth give to thee according to thy heart, And all thy counsel doth fulfil.

<sup>5</sup> We sing of thy salvation, And in the name of our God set up a banner. Jehovah doth fulfil all thy requests.

<sup>6</sup> Now I have known That Jehovah hath saved His anointed, He answereth him from His holy heavens, With the saving might of His right hand.

<sup>7</sup> Some of chariots, and some of horses, And we of the name of Jehovah our God Make mention.

<sup>8</sup> They — they have bowed and have fallen, And we have risen and station ourselves upright.

<sup>9</sup> O Jehovah, save the king, He doth answer us in the day we call!
