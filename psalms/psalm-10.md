# Psalm 10 

**¹** Why, Jehovah, dost Thou stand at a distance? Thou dost hide in times of adversity,

**²** Through the pride of the wicked, Is the poor inflamed, They are caught in devices that they devised.

**³** Because the wicked hath boasted Of the desire of his soul, And a dishonest gainer he hath blessed, He hath despised Jehovah.

**⁴** The wicked according to the height of his face, inquireth not. 'God is not!' [are] all his devices.

**⁵** Pain do his ways at all times, On high [are] Thy judgments before him, All his adversaries — he puffeth at them.

**⁶** He hath said in his heart, 'I am not moved,' To generation and generation not in evil.

**⁷** Of oaths his mouth is full, And deceits, and fraud: Under his tongue [is] perverseness and iniquity,

**⁸** He doth sit in an ambush of the villages, In secret places he doth slay the innocent. His eyes for the afflicted watch secretly,

**⁹** He lieth in wait in a secret place, as a lion in a covert. He lieth in wait to catch the poor, He catcheth the poor, drawing him into his net.

**¹⁰** He is bruised — he boweth down, Fallen by his mighty ones hath the afflicted.

**¹¹** He said in his heart, 'God hath forgotten, He hath hid His face, He hath never seen.'

**¹²** Arise, O Jehovah! O God, lift up Thy hand! Forget not the humble.

**¹³** Wherefore hath the wicked despised God? He hath said in his heart, 'It is not required.'

**¹⁴** Thou hast seen, For Thou perverseness and anger beholdest; By giving into Thy hand, On Thee doth the afflicted leave [it], Of the fatherless Thou hast been an helper.

**¹⁵** Break the arm of the wicked and the evil, Seek out his wickedness, find none;

**¹⁶** Jehovah [is] king to the age, and for ever, The nations have perished out of His land!

**¹⁷** The desire of the humble Thou hast heard, O Jehovah. Thou preparest their heart; Thou causest Thine ear to attend,

**¹⁸** To judge the fatherless and bruised: He addeth no more to oppress — man of the earth!
