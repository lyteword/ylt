# Psalm 16

<sup>1</sup> A Secret Treasure of David. Preserve me, O God, for I did trust in Thee.

<sup>2</sup> Thou hast said to Jehovah, 'My Lord Thou [art];' My good [is] not for thine own sake;

<sup>3</sup> For the holy ones who [are] in the land, And the honourable, all my delight [is] in them.

<sup>4</sup> Multiplied are their griefs, [Who] have hastened backward; I pour not out their libations of blood, Nor do I take up their names on my lips.

<sup>5</sup> Jehovah [is] the portion of my share, and of my cup, Thou — Thou dost uphold my lot.

<sup>6</sup> Lines have fallen to me in pleasant places, Yea, a beauteous inheritance [is] for me.

<sup>7</sup> I bless Jehovah who hath counselled me; Also [in] the nights my reins instruct me.

<sup>8</sup> I did place Jehovah before me continually, Because — at my right hand I am not moved.

<sup>9</sup> Therefore hath my heart been glad, And my honour doth rejoice, Also my flesh dwelleth confidently:

<sup>10</sup> For Thou dost not leave my soul to Sheol, Nor givest thy saintly one to see corruption.

<sup>11</sup> Thou causest me to know the path of life; Fulness of joys [is] with Thy presence, Pleasant things by Thy right hand for ever!
