# Psalm 60

**¹** To the Overseer. — 'Concerning the Lily of Testimony,' a secret treasure of David, to teach, in his striving with Aram-Naharaim, and with Aram-Zobah, and Joab turneth back and smiteth Edom in the valley of Salt — twelve thousand. O God, Thou hadst cast us off, Thou hadst broken us — hadst been angry! — Thou dost turn back to us.

**²** Thou hast caused the land to tremble, Thou hast broken it, Heal its breaches, for it hath moved.

**³** Thou hast shewn Thy people a hard thing, Thou hast caused us to drink wine of trembling.

**⁴** Thou hast given to those fearing thee an ensign. To be lifted up as an ensign Because of truth. Selah.

**⁵** That Thy beloved ones may be drawn out, Save [with] Thy right hand, and answer us.

**⁶** God hath spoken in His holiness: I exult — I apportion Shechem, And the valley of Succoth I measure,

**⁷** Mine [is] Gilead, and mine [is] Manasseh, And Ephraim [is] the strength of my head, Judah [is] my lawgiver,

**⁸** Moab [is] my pot for washing, over Edom I cast my shoe, Shout, concerning me, O Philistia.

**⁹** Who doth bring me [to] a city of bulwarks? Who hath led me unto Edom?

**¹⁰** Is it not Thou, O God? hast Thou cast us off? And dost Thou not go forth, O God, with our hosts!

**¹¹** Give to us help from adversity, And vain [is] the deliverance of man.

**¹²** In God we do mightily, And He treadeth down our adversaries!
