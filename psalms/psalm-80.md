# Psalm 80

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer. — 'On the Lilies.' A testimony of Asaph. — A Psalm. Shepherd of Israel, give ear, Leading Joseph as a flock, Inhabiting the cherubs — shine forth,

<sup>2</sup> Before Ephraim, and Benjamin, and Manasseh, Wake up Thy might, and come for our salvation.

<sup>3</sup> O God, cause us to turn back, And cause Thy face to shine, and we are saved.

<sup>4</sup> Jehovah, God of Hosts, till when? Thou hast burned against the prayer of Thy people.

<sup>5</sup> Thou hast caused them to eat bread of tears, And causest them to drink With tears a third time.

<sup>6</sup> Thou makest us a strife to our neighbours, And our enemies mock at it.

<sup>7</sup> God of Hosts, turn us back, And cause Thy face to shine, and we are saved.

<sup>8</sup> A vine out of Egypt Thou dost bring, Thou dost cast out nations, and plantest it.

<sup>9</sup> Thou hast looked before it, and dost root it, And it filleth the land,

<sup>10</sup> Covered have been hills [with] its shadow, And its boughs [are] cedars of God.

<sup>11</sup> It sendeth forth its branches unto the sea, And unto the river its sucklings.

<sup>12</sup> Why hast Thou broken down its hedges, And all passing by the way have plucked it?

<sup>13</sup> A boar out of the forest doth waste it, And a wild beast of the fields consumeth it.

<sup>14</sup> God of Hosts, turn back, we beseech Thee, Look from heaven, and see, and inspect this vine,

<sup>15</sup> And the root that Thy right hand planted, And the branch Thou madest strong for Thee,

<sup>16</sup> Burnt with fire — cut down, From the rebuke of Thy face they perish.

<sup>17</sup> Let Thy hand be on the man of Thy right hand, On the son of man Thou hast strengthened for Thyself.

<sup>18</sup> And we do not go back from Thee, Thou dost revive us, and in Thy name we call.

<sup>19</sup> O Jehovah, God of Hosts, turn us back, Cause Thy face to shine, and we are saved!
