# Psalm 80

**¹** To the Overseer. — 'On the Lilies.' A testimony of Asaph. — A Psalm. Shepherd of Israel, give ear, Leading Joseph as a flock, Inhabiting the cherubs — shine forth,

**²** Before Ephraim, and Benjamin, and Manasseh, Wake up Thy might, and come for our salvation.

**³** O God, cause us to turn back, And cause Thy face to shine, and we are saved.

**⁴** Jehovah, God of Hosts, till when? Thou hast burned against the prayer of Thy people.

**⁵** Thou hast caused them to eat bread of tears, And causest them to drink With tears a third time.

**⁶** Thou makest us a strife to our neighbours, And our enemies mock at it.

**⁷** God of Hosts, turn us back, And cause Thy face to shine, and we are saved.

**⁸** A vine out of Egypt Thou dost bring, Thou dost cast out nations, and plantest it.

**⁹** Thou hast looked before it, and dost root it, And it filleth the land,

**¹⁰** Covered have been hills [with] its shadow, And its boughs [are] cedars of God.

**¹¹** It sendeth forth its branches unto the sea, And unto the river its sucklings.

**¹²** Why hast Thou broken down its hedges, And all passing by the way have plucked it?

**¹³** A boar out of the forest doth waste it, And a wild beast of the fields consumeth it.

**¹⁴** God of Hosts, turn back, we beseech Thee, Look from heaven, and see, and inspect this vine,

**¹⁵** And the root that Thy right hand planted, And the branch Thou madest strong for Thee,

**¹⁶** Burnt with fire — cut down, From the rebuke of Thy face they perish.

**¹⁷** Let Thy hand be on the man of Thy right hand, On the son of man Thou hast strengthened for Thyself.

**¹⁸** And we do not go back from Thee, Thou dost revive us, and in Thy name we call.

**¹⁹** O Jehovah, God of Hosts, turn us back, Cause Thy face to shine, and we are saved!
