# Psalm 88 

**¹** A Song, a Psalm, by sons of Korah, to the Overseer, 'Concerning the Sickness of Afflictions.' — An instruction, by Heman the Ezrahite. O Jehovah, God of my salvation, Daily I have cried, nightly before Thee,

**²** My prayer cometh in before Thee, Incline Thine ear to my loud cry,

**³** For my soul hath been full of evils, And my life hath come to Sheol.

**⁴** I have been reckoned with those going down [to] the pit, I have been as a man without strength.

**⁵** Among the dead — free, As pierced ones lying in the grave, Whom Thou hast not remembered any more, Yea, they by Thy hand have been cut off.

**⁶** Thou hast put me in the lowest pit, In dark places, in depths.

**⁷** Upon me hath Thy fury lain, And [with] all Thy breakers Thou hast afflicted. Selah.

**⁸** Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me, Thou hast made me an abomination to them, Shut up — I go not forth.

**⁹** Mine eye hath grieved because of affliction, I called Thee, O Jehovah, all the day, I have spread out unto Thee my hands.

**¹⁰** To the dead dost Thou do wonders? Do Rephaim rise? do they thank Thee? Selah.

**¹¹** Is Thy kindness recounted in the grave? Thy faithfulness in destruction?

**¹²** Are Thy wonders known in the darkness? And Thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?

**¹³** And I, unto Thee, O Jehovah, I have cried, And in the morning doth my prayer come before Thee.

**¹⁴** Why, O Jehovah, castest Thou off my soul? Thou hidest Thy face from me.

**¹⁵** I [am] afflicted, and expiring from youth, I have borne Thy terrors — I pine away.

**¹⁶** Over me hath Thy wrath passed, Thy terrors have cut me off,

**¹⁷** They have surrounded me as waters all the day, They have gone round against me together,

**¹⁸** Thou hast put far from me lover and friend, Mine acquaintance [is] the place of darkness!
