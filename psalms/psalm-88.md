# Psalm 88

<sup>1</sup> A Song, a Psalm, by sons of Korah, to the Overseer, 'Concerning the Sickness of Afflictions.' — An instruction, by Heman the Ezrahite. O Jehovah, God of my salvation, Daily I have cried, nightly before Thee,

<sup>2</sup> My prayer cometh in before Thee, Incline Thine ear to my loud cry,

<sup>3</sup> For my soul hath been full of evils, And my life hath come to Sheol.

<sup>4</sup> I have been reckoned with those going down [to] the pit, I have been as a man without strength.

<sup>5</sup> Among the dead — free, As pierced ones lying in the grave, Whom Thou hast not remembered any more, Yea, they by Thy hand have been cut off.

<sup>6</sup> Thou hast put me in the lowest pit, In dark places, in depths.

<sup>7</sup> Upon me hath Thy fury lain, And [with] all Thy breakers Thou hast afflicted. Selah.

<sup>8</sup> Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me, Thou hast made me an abomination to them, Shut up — I go not forth.

<sup>9</sup> Mine eye hath grieved because of affliction, I called Thee, O Jehovah, all the day, I have spread out unto Thee my hands.

<sup>10</sup> To the dead dost Thou do wonders? Do Rephaim rise? do they thank Thee? Selah.

<sup>11</sup> Is Thy kindness recounted in the grave? Thy faithfulness in destruction?

<sup>12</sup> Are Thy wonders known in the darkness? And Thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?

<sup>13</sup> And I, unto Thee, O Jehovah, I have cried, And in the morning doth my prayer come before Thee.

<sup>14</sup> Why, O Jehovah, castest Thou off my soul? Thou hidest Thy face from me.

<sup>15</sup> I [am] afflicted, and expiring from youth, I have borne Thy terrors — I pine away.

<sup>16</sup> Over me hath Thy wrath passed, Thy terrors have cut me off,

<sup>17</sup> They have surrounded me as waters all the day, They have gone round against me together,

<sup>18</sup> Thou hast put far from me lover and friend, Mine acquaintance [is] the place of darkness!
