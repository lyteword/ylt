# Psalm 38

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David, 'To cause to remember.' Jehovah, in Thy wrath reprove me not, Nor in Thy fury chastise me.

<sup>2</sup> For Thine arrows have come down on me, And Thou lettest down upon me Thy hand.

<sup>3</sup> Soundness is not in my flesh, Because of Thine indignation, Peace is not in my bones because of my sin.

<sup>4</sup> For mine iniquities have passed over my head, As a heavy burden — too heavy for me.

<sup>5</sup> Stunk — become corrupt have my wounds, Because of my folly.

<sup>6</sup> I have been bent down, I have been bowed down — unto excess, All the day I have gone mourning.

<sup>7</sup> For my flanks have been full of drought, And soundness is not in my flesh.

<sup>8</sup> I have been feeble and smitten — unto excess, I have roared from disquietude of heart.

<sup>9</sup> Lord, before Thee [is] all my desire, And my sighing from Thee hath not been hid.

<sup>10</sup> My heart [is] panting, my power hath forsaken me, And the light of mine eyes, Even they are not with me.

<sup>11</sup> My lovers and my friends over-against my plague stand. And my neighbours afar off have stood.

<sup>12</sup> And those seeking my soul lay a snare, And those seeking my evil Have spoken mischievous things, And they do deceits meditate all the day.

<sup>13</sup> And I, as deaf, hear not. And as a dumb one who openeth not his mouth.

<sup>14</sup> Yea, I am as a man who heareth not, And in his mouth are no reproofs.

<sup>15</sup> Because for Thee, O Jehovah, I have waited, Thou dost answer, O Lord my God.

<sup>16</sup> When I said, 'Lest they rejoice over me, In the slipping of my foot against me they magnified themselves.

<sup>17</sup> For I am ready to halt, And my pain [is] before me continually.

<sup>18</sup> For mine iniquity I declare, I am sorry for my sin.

<sup>19</sup> And mine enemies [are] lively, They have been strong, and those hating me without cause, Have been multiplied.

<sup>20</sup> And those paying evil for good accuse me, Because of my pursuing good.

<sup>21</sup> Do not forsake me, O Jehovah, My God, be not far from me,

<sup>22</sup> Haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation!
