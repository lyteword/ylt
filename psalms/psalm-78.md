# Psalm 78

<sup>1</sup> An Instruction of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my law, Incline your ear to sayings of my mouth.

<sup>2</sup> I open with a simile my mouth, I bring forth hidden things of old,

<sup>3</sup> That we have heard and do know, And our fathers have recounted to us.

<sup>4</sup> We do not hide from their sons, To a later generation recounting praises of Jehovah, And His strength, and His wonders that He hath done.

<sup>5</sup> And He raiseth up a testimony in Jacob, And a law hath placed in Israel, That He commanded our fathers, To make them known to their sons.

<sup>6</sup> So that a later generation doth know, Sons who are born, do rise and recount to their sons,

<sup>7</sup> And place in God their confidence, And forget not the doings of God, But keep His commands.

<sup>8</sup> And they are not like their fathers, A generation apostate and rebellious, A generation! it hath not prepared its heart, Nor stedfast with God [is] its spirit.

<sup>9</sup> Sons of Ephraim — armed bearers of bow, Have turned in a day of conflict.

<sup>10</sup> They have not kept the covenant of God, And in His law they have refused to walk,

<sup>11</sup> And they forget His doings, And His wonders that He shewed them.

<sup>12</sup> Before their fathers He hath done wonders, In the land of Egypt — the field of Zoan.

<sup>13</sup> He cleft a sea, and causeth them to pass over, Yea, He causeth waters to stand as a heap.

<sup>14</sup> And leadeth them with a cloud by day, And all the night with a light of fire.

<sup>15</sup> He cleaveth rocks in a wilderness, And giveth drink — as the great deep.

<sup>16</sup> And bringeth out streams from a rock, And causeth waters to come down as rivers.

<sup>17</sup> And they add still to sin against Him, To provoke the Most High in the dry place.

<sup>18</sup> And they try God in their heart, To ask food for their lust.

<sup>19</sup> And they speak against God — they said: 'Is God able to array a table in a wilderness?'

<sup>20</sup> Lo, He hath smitten a rock, And waters flow, yea, streams overflow. 'Also — bread [is] He able to give? Doth He prepare flesh for His people?'

<sup>21</sup> Therefore hath Jehovah heard, And He sheweth Himself wroth, And fire hath been kindled against Jacob, And anger also hath gone up against Israel,

<sup>22</sup> For they have not believed in God, Nor have they trusted in His salvation.

<sup>23</sup> And He commandeth clouds from above, Yea, doors of the heavens He hath opened.

<sup>24</sup> And He raineth on them manna to eat, Yea, corn of heaven He hath given to them.

<sup>25</sup> Food of the mighty hath each eaten, Venison He sent to them to satiety.

<sup>26</sup> He causeth an east wind to journey in the heavens, And leadeth by His strength a south wind,

<sup>27</sup> And He raineth on them flesh as dust, And as sand of the seas — winged fowl,

<sup>28</sup> And causeth [it] to fall in the midst of His camp, Round about His tabernacles.

<sup>29</sup> And they eat, and are greatly satisfied, And their desire He bringeth to them.

<sup>30</sup> They have not been estranged from their desire, Yet [is] their food in their mouth,

<sup>31</sup> And the anger of God hath gone up against them, And He slayeth among their fat ones, And youths of Israel He caused to bend.

<sup>32</sup> With all this they have sinned again, And have not believed in His wonders.

<sup>33</sup> And He consumeth in vanity their days, And their years in trouble.

<sup>34</sup> If He slew them, then they sought Him, And turned back, and sought God earnestly,

<sup>35</sup> And they remember that God [is] their rock, And God Most High their redeemer.

<sup>36</sup> And — they deceive Him with their mouth, And with their tongue do lie to Him,

<sup>37</sup> And their heart hath not been right with Him, And they have not been stedfast in His covenant.

<sup>38</sup> And He — the Merciful One, Pardoneth iniquity, and destroyeth not, And hath often turned back His anger, And waketh not up all His fury.

<sup>39</sup> And He remembereth that they [are] flesh, A wind going on — and it returneth not.

<sup>40</sup> How often do they provoke Him in the wilderness, Grieve Him in the desolate place?

<sup>41</sup> Yea, they turn back, and try God, And the Holy One of Israel have limited.

<sup>42</sup> They have not remembered His hand The day He ransomed them from the adversary.

<sup>43</sup> When He set His signs in Egypt, And His wonders in the field of Zoan,

<sup>44</sup> And He turneth to blood their streams, And their floods they drink not.

<sup>45</sup> He sendeth among them the beetle, and it consumeth them, And the frog, and it destroyeth them,

<sup>46</sup> And giveth to the caterpillar their increase, And their labour to the locust.

<sup>47</sup> He destroyeth with hail their vine, And their sycamores with frost,

<sup>48</sup> And delivereth up to the hail their beasts, And their cattle to the burning flames.

<sup>49</sup> He sendeth on them the fury of His anger, Wrath, and indignation, and distress — A discharge of evil messengers.

<sup>50</sup> He pondereth a path for His anger, He kept not back their soul from death, Yea, their life to the pestilence He delivered up.

<sup>51</sup> And He smiteth every first-born in Egypt, The first-fruit of the strong in tents of Ham.

<sup>52</sup> And causeth His people to journey as a flock, And guideth them as a drove in a wilderness,

<sup>53</sup> And He leadeth them confidently, And they have not been afraid, And their enemies hath the sea covered.

<sup>54</sup> And He bringeth them in unto the border of His sanctuary, This mountain His right hand had got,

<sup>55</sup> And casteth out nations from before them, And causeth them to fall in the line of inheritance, And causeth the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents,

<sup>56</sup> And they tempt and provoke God Most High, And His testimonies have not kept.

<sup>57</sup> And they turn back, And deal treacherously like their fathers, They have been turned like a deceitful bow,

<sup>58</sup> And make Him angry with their high places, And with their graven images make Him zealous,

<sup>59</sup> God hath heard, and sheweth Himself wroth. And kicketh exceedingly against Israel.

<sup>60</sup> And He leaveth the tabernacle of Shiloh, The tent He had placed among men,

<sup>61</sup> And He giveth His strength to captivity, And His beauty into the hand of an adversary,

<sup>62</sup> And delivereth up to the sword His people, And with His inheritance shewed Himself angry.

<sup>63</sup> His young men hath fire consumed, And His virgins have not been praised.

<sup>64</sup> His priests by the sword have fallen, And their widows weep not.

<sup>65</sup> And the Lord waketh as a sleeper, As a mighty one crying aloud from wine.

<sup>66</sup> And He smiteth His adversaries backward, A reproach age-during He hath put on them,

<sup>67</sup> And He kicketh against the tent of Joseph, And on the tribe of Ephraim hath not fixed.

<sup>68</sup> And He chooseth the tribe of Judah, With mount Zion that He loved,

<sup>69</sup> And buildeth His sanctuary as a high place, Like the earth, He founded it to the age.

<sup>70</sup> And He fixeth on David His servant, And taketh him from the folds of a flock,

<sup>71</sup> From behind suckling ones He hath brought him in, To rule over Jacob His people, And over Israel His inheritance.

<sup>72</sup> And he ruleth them according to the integrity of his heart, And by the skilfulness of his hands leadeth them!
