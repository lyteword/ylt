# Psalm 78 

**¹** An Instruction of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my law, Incline your ear to sayings of my mouth.

**²** I open with a simile my mouth, I bring forth hidden things of old,

**³** That we have heard and do know, And our fathers have recounted to us.

**⁴** We do not hide from their sons, To a later generation recounting praises of Jehovah, And His strength, and His wonders that He hath done.

**⁵** And He raiseth up a testimony in Jacob, And a law hath placed in Israel, That He commanded our fathers, To make them known to their sons.

**⁶** So that a later generation doth know, Sons who are born, do rise and recount to their sons,

**⁷** And place in God their confidence, And forget not the doings of God, But keep His commands.

**⁸** And they are not like their fathers, A generation apostate and rebellious, A generation! it hath not prepared its heart, Nor stedfast with God [is] its spirit.

**⁹** Sons of Ephraim — armed bearers of bow, Have turned in a day of conflict.

**¹⁰** They have not kept the covenant of God, And in His law they have refused to walk,

**¹¹** And they forget His doings, And His wonders that He shewed them.

**¹²** Before their fathers He hath done wonders, In the land of Egypt — the field of Zoan.

**¹³** He cleft a sea, and causeth them to pass over, Yea, He causeth waters to stand as a heap.

**¹⁴** And leadeth them with a cloud by day, And all the night with a light of fire.

**¹⁵** He cleaveth rocks in a wilderness, And giveth drink — as the great deep.

**¹⁶** And bringeth out streams from a rock, And causeth waters to come down as rivers.

**¹⁷** And they add still to sin against Him, To provoke the Most High in the dry place.

**¹⁸** And they try God in their heart, To ask food for their lust.

**¹⁹** And they speak against God — they said: 'Is God able to array a table in a wilderness?'

**²⁰** Lo, He hath smitten a rock, And waters flow, yea, streams overflow. 'Also — bread [is] He able to give? Doth He prepare flesh for His people?'

**²¹** Therefore hath Jehovah heard, And He sheweth Himself wroth, And fire hath been kindled against Jacob, And anger also hath gone up against Israel,

**²²** For they have not believed in God, Nor have they trusted in His salvation.

**²³** And He commandeth clouds from above, Yea, doors of the heavens He hath opened.

**²⁴** And He raineth on them manna to eat, Yea, corn of heaven He hath given to them.

**²⁵** Food of the mighty hath each eaten, Venison He sent to them to satiety.

**²⁶** He causeth an east wind to journey in the heavens, And leadeth by His strength a south wind,

**²⁷** And He raineth on them flesh as dust, And as sand of the seas — winged fowl,

**²⁸** And causeth [it] to fall in the midst of His camp, Round about His tabernacles.

**²⁹** And they eat, and are greatly satisfied, And their desire He bringeth to them.

**³⁰** They have not been estranged from their desire, Yet [is] their food in their mouth,

**³¹** And the anger of God hath gone up against them, And He slayeth among their fat ones, And youths of Israel He caused to bend.

**³²** With all this they have sinned again, And have not believed in His wonders.

**³³** And He consumeth in vanity their days, And their years in trouble.

**³⁴** If He slew them, then they sought Him, And turned back, and sought God earnestly,

**³⁵** And they remember that God [is] their rock, And God Most High their redeemer.

**³⁶** And — they deceive Him with their mouth, And with their tongue do lie to Him,

**³⁷** And their heart hath not been right with Him, And they have not been stedfast in His covenant.

**³⁸** And He — the Merciful One, Pardoneth iniquity, and destroyeth not, And hath often turned back His anger, And waketh not up all His fury.

**³⁹** And He remembereth that they [are] flesh, A wind going on — and it returneth not.

**⁴⁰** How often do they provoke Him in the wilderness, Grieve Him in the desolate place?

**⁴¹** Yea, they turn back, and try God, And the Holy One of Israel have limited.

**⁴²** They have not remembered His hand The day He ransomed them from the adversary.

**⁴³** When He set His signs in Egypt, And His wonders in the field of Zoan,

**⁴⁴** And He turneth to blood their streams, And their floods they drink not.

**⁴⁵** He sendeth among them the beetle, and it consumeth them, And the frog, and it destroyeth them,

**⁴⁶** And giveth to the caterpillar their increase, And their labour to the locust.

**⁴⁷** He destroyeth with hail their vine, And their sycamores with frost,

**⁴⁸** And delivereth up to the hail their beasts, And their cattle to the burning flames.

**⁴⁹** He sendeth on them the fury of His anger, Wrath, and indignation, and distress — A discharge of evil messengers.

**⁵⁰** He pondereth a path for His anger, He kept not back their soul from death, Yea, their life to the pestilence He delivered up.

**⁵¹** And He smiteth every first-born in Egypt, The first-fruit of the strong in tents of Ham.

**⁵²** And causeth His people to journey as a flock, And guideth them as a drove in a wilderness,

**⁵³** And He leadeth them confidently, And they have not been afraid, And their enemies hath the sea covered.

**⁵⁴** And He bringeth them in unto the border of His sanctuary, This mountain His right hand had got,

**⁵⁵** And casteth out nations from before them, And causeth them to fall in the line of inheritance, And causeth the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents,

**⁵⁶** And they tempt and provoke God Most High, And His testimonies have not kept.

**⁵⁷** And they turn back, And deal treacherously like their fathers, They have been turned like a deceitful bow,

**⁵⁸** And make Him angry with their high places, And with their graven images make Him zealous,

**⁵⁹** God hath heard, and sheweth Himself wroth. And kicketh exceedingly against Israel.

**⁶⁰** And He leaveth the tabernacle of Shiloh, The tent He had placed among men,

**⁶¹** And He giveth His strength to captivity, And His beauty into the hand of an adversary,

**⁶²** And delivereth up to the sword His people, And with His inheritance shewed Himself angry.

**⁶³** His young men hath fire consumed, And His virgins have not been praised.

**⁶⁴** His priests by the sword have fallen, And their widows weep not.

**⁶⁵** And the Lord waketh as a sleeper, As a mighty one crying aloud from wine.

**⁶⁶** And He smiteth His adversaries backward, A reproach age-during He hath put on them,

**⁶⁷** And He kicketh against the tent of Joseph, And on the tribe of Ephraim hath not fixed.

**⁶⁸** And He chooseth the tribe of Judah, With mount Zion that He loved,

**⁶⁹** And buildeth His sanctuary as a high place, Like the earth, He founded it to the age.

**⁷⁰** And He fixeth on David His servant, And taketh him from the folds of a flock,

**⁷¹** From behind suckling ones He hath brought him in, To rule over Jacob His people, And over Israel His inheritance.

**⁷²** And he ruleth them according to the integrity of his heart, And by the skilfulness of his hands leadeth them!
