# Psalm 79 

**¹** A Psalm of Asaph. O God, nations have come into Thy inheritance, They have defiled Thy holy temple, They made Jerusalem become heaps,

**²** They gave the dead bodies of Thy servants Food for the fowls of the heavens, The flesh of Thy saints For the wild beast of the earth.

**³** They have shed their blood As water round about Jerusalem, And there is none burying.

**⁴** We have been a reproach to our neighbours, A scorn and a derision to our surrounders.

**⁵** Till when, O Jehovah? art Thou angry for ever? Thy jealousy doth burn as fire.

**⁶** Pour Thy fury on the nations who have not known Thee, And on kingdoms that have not called in Thy name.

**⁷** For [one] hath devoured Jacob, And his habitation they have made desolate.

**⁸** Remember not for us the iniquities of forefathers, Haste, let Thy mercies go before us, For we have been very weak.

**⁹** Help us, O God of our salvation, Because of the honour of Thy name, And deliver us, and cover over our sins, For Thy name's sake.

**¹⁰** Why do the nations say, 'Where [is] their God?' Let be known among the nations before our eyes, The vengeance of the blood of Thy servants that is shed.

**¹¹** Let the groaning of the prisoner come in before Thee, According to the greatness of Thine arm, Leave Thou the sons of death.

**¹²** And turn Thou back to our neighbours, Sevenfold unto their bosom, their reproach, Wherewith they reproached Thee, O Lord.

**¹³** And we, Thy people, and the flock of Thy pasture, We give thanks to Thee to the age, To all generations we recount Thy praise!
