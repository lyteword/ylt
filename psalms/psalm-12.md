# Psalm 12

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer, on the octave. — A Psalm of David. Save, Jehovah, for the saintly hath failed, For the stedfast have ceased From the sons of men:

<sup>2</sup> Vanity they speak each with his neighbour, Lip of flattery! With heart and heart they speak.

<sup>3</sup> Jehovah doth cut off all lips of flattery, A tongue speaking great things,

<sup>4</sup> Who said, 'By our tongue we do mightily: Our lips [are] our own; who [is] lord over us?'

<sup>5</sup> Because of the spoiling of the poor, Because of the groaning of the needy, Now do I arise, saith Jehovah, I set in safety [him who] doth breathe for it.

<sup>6</sup> Sayings of Jehovah [are] pure sayings; Silver tried in a furnace of earth refined sevenfold.

<sup>7</sup> Thou, O Jehovah, dost preserve them, Thou keepest us from this generation to the age.

<sup>8</sup> Around the wicked walk continually, According as vileness is exalted by sons of men!
