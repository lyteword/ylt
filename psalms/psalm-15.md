# Psalm 15 

**¹** A Psalm of David. Jehovah, who doth sojourn in Thy tent? Who doth dwell in Thy holy hill?

**²** He who is walking uprightly, And working righteousness, And speaking truth in his heart.

**³** He hath not slandered by his tongue, He hath not done to his friend evil; And reproach he hath not lifted up Against his neighbour.

**⁴** Despised in his eyes [is] a rejected one, And those fearing Jehovah he doth honour. He hath sworn to suffer evil, and changeth not;

**⁵** His silver he hath not given in usury, And a bribe against the innocent Hath not taken; Whoso is doing these is not moved to the age!
