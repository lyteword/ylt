# Psalm 99

<sup>1</sup> Jehovah hath reigned, peoples tremble, The Inhabitant of the cherubs, the earth shaketh.

<sup>2</sup> Jehovah in Zion [is] great, And high He [is] over all the peoples.

<sup>3</sup> They praise Thy name, 'Great, and fearful, holy [it] is.'

<sup>4</sup> And the strength of the king Hath loved judgment, Thou — Thou hast established uprightness; Judgment and righteousness in Jacob, Thou — Thou hast done.

<sup>5</sup> Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And bow yourselves at His footstool, holy [is] He.

<sup>6</sup> Moses and Aaron among His priests, And Samuel among those proclaiming His name. They are calling unto Jehovah, And He doth answer them.

<sup>7</sup> In a pillar of cloud He speaketh unto them, They have kept His testimonies, And the statute He hath given to them.

<sup>8</sup> O Jehovah, our God, Thou hast afflicted them, A God forgiving Thou hast been to them, And taking vengeance on their actions.

<sup>9</sup> Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And bow yourselves at His holy hill, For holy [is] Jehovah our God!
