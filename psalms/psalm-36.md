# Psalm 36

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer. — By a servant of Jehovah, by David. The transgression of the wicked Is affirming within my heart, 'Fear of God is not before his eyes,

<sup>2</sup> For he made [it] smooth to himself in his eyes, To find his iniquity to be hated.

<sup>3</sup> The words of his mouth [are] iniquity and deceit, He ceased to act prudently — to do good.

<sup>4</sup> Iniquity he deviseth on his bed, He stationeth himself on a way not good, Evil he doth not refuse.'

<sup>5</sup> O Jehovah, in the heavens [is] Thy kindness, Thy faithfulness [is] unto the clouds.

<sup>6</sup> Thy righteousness [is] as mountains of God, Thy judgments [are] a great deep. Man and beast Thou savest, O Jehovah.

<sup>7</sup> How precious [is] Thy kindness, O God, And the sons of men In the shadow of Thy wings do trust.

<sup>8</sup> They are filled from the fatness of Thy house, And the stream of Thy delights Thou dost cause them to drink.

<sup>9</sup> For with Thee [is] a fountain of life, In Thy light we see light.

<sup>10</sup> Draw out Thy kindness to those knowing Thee, And Thy righteousness to the upright of heart.

<sup>11</sup> Let not a foot of pride meet me, And a hand of the wicked let not move me.

<sup>12</sup> There have workers of iniquity fallen, They have been overthrown, And have not been able to arise!
