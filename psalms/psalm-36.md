# Psalm 36

**¹** To the Overseer. — By a servant of Jehovah, by David. The transgression of the wicked Is affirming within my heart, 'Fear of God is not before his eyes,

**²** For he made [it] smooth to himself in his eyes, To find his iniquity to be hated.

**³** The words of his mouth [are] iniquity and deceit, He ceased to act prudently — to do good.

**⁴** Iniquity he deviseth on his bed, He stationeth himself on a way not good, Evil he doth not refuse.'

**⁵** O Jehovah, in the heavens [is] Thy kindness, Thy faithfulness [is] unto the clouds.

**⁶** Thy righteousness [is] as mountains of God, Thy judgments [are] a great deep. Man and beast Thou savest, O Jehovah.

**⁷** How precious [is] Thy kindness, O God, And the sons of men In the shadow of Thy wings do trust.

**⁸** They are filled from the fatness of Thy house, And the stream of Thy delights Thou dost cause them to drink.

**⁹** For with Thee [is] a fountain of life, In Thy light we see light.

**¹⁰** Draw out Thy kindness to those knowing Thee, And Thy righteousness to the upright of heart.

**¹¹** Let not a foot of pride meet me, And a hand of the wicked let not move me.

**¹²** There have workers of iniquity fallen, They have been overthrown, And have not been able to arise!
