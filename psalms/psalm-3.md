# Psalm 3 

**¹** A Psalm of David, in his fleeing from the face of Absalom his son. Jehovah, how have my distresses multiplied! Many are rising up against me.

**²** Many are saying of my soul, 'There is no salvation for him in God.' Selah.

**³** And Thou, O Jehovah, [art] a shield for me, My honour, and lifter up of my head.

**⁴** My voice [is] unto Jehovah: I call: And He answereth me from his holy hill, Selah.

**⁵** I — I have lain down, and I sleep, I have waked, for Jehovah sustaineth me.

**⁶** I am not afraid of myriads of people, That round about they have set against me.

**⁷** Rise, O Jehovah! save me, my God. Because Thou hast smitten All mine enemies [on] the cheek. The teeth of the wicked Thou hast broken.

**⁸** Of Jehovah [is] this salvation; On Thy people [is] Thy blessing! Selah.
