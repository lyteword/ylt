# Psalm 32

<sup>1</sup> By David. — An Instruction. O the happiness of him whose transgression [is] forgiven, Whose sin is covered.

<sup>2</sup> O the happiness of a man, To whom Jehovah imputeth not iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no deceit.

<sup>3</sup> When I have kept silence, become old have my bones, Through my roaring all the day.

<sup>4</sup> When by day and by night Thy hand is heavy upon me, My moisture hath been changed Into the droughts of summer. Selah.

<sup>5</sup> My sin I cause Thee to know, And mine iniquity I have not covered. I have said, 'I confess concerning My transgressions to Jehovah,' And Thou — Thou hast taken away, The iniquity of my sin. Selah.

<sup>6</sup> For this doth every saintly one pray to Thee, As the time to find. Surely at an overflowing of many waters, Unto him they come not.

<sup>7</sup> Thou [art] a hiding-place for me, From distress Thou dost keep me, [With] songs of deliverance dost compass me. Selah.

<sup>8</sup> I cause thee to act wisely, And direct thee in the way that thou goest, I cause mine eye to take counsel concerning thee.

<sup>9</sup> Be ye not as a horse — as a mule, Without understanding, With bridle and bit, its ornaments, to curb, Not to come near unto thee.

<sup>10</sup> Many [are] the pains of the wicked; As to him who is trusting in Jehovah, Kindness doth compass him.

<sup>11</sup> Be glad in Jehovah, and rejoice, ye righteous, And sing, all ye upright of heart!
