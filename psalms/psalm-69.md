# Psalm 69

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer. — 'On the Lilies,' by David. Save me, O God, for come have waters unto the soul.

<sup>2</sup> I have sunk in deep mire, And there is no standing, I have come into the depths of the waters, And a flood hath overflown me.

<sup>3</sup> I have been wearied with my calling, Burnt hath been my throat, Consumed have been mine eyes, waiting for my God.

<sup>4</sup> Those hating me without cause Have been more than the hairs of my head, Mighty have been my destroyers, My lying enemies, That which I took not away — I bring back.

<sup>5</sup> O God, Thou — Thou hast known Concerning my overturn, And my desolations from Thee have not been hid.

<sup>6</sup> Let not those waiting on Thee be ashamed because of me, O Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, Let not those seeking Thee Blush because of me, O God of Israel.

<sup>7</sup> For because of Thee I have borne reproach, Shame hath covered my face.

<sup>8</sup> A stranger I have been to my brother, And a foreigner to sons of my mother.

<sup>9</sup> For zeal for Thy house hath consumed me, And the reproaches of Thy reproachers Have fallen upon me.

<sup>10</sup> And I weep in the fasting of my soul, And it is for a reproach to me.

<sup>11</sup> And I make my clothing sackcloth, And I am to them for a simile.

<sup>12</sup> Those sitting at the gate meditate concerning me, And those drinking strong drink, Play on instruments.

<sup>13</sup> And I — my prayer [is] to Thee, O Jehovah, A time of good pleasure, O God, In the abundance of Thy kindness, Answer me in the truth of Thy salvation.

<sup>14</sup> Deliver me from the mire, and let me not sink, Let me be delivered from those hating me, And from deep places of waters.

<sup>15</sup> Let not a flood of waters overflow me, Nor let the deep swallow me up, Nor let the pit shut her mouth upon me.

<sup>16</sup> Answer me, O Jehovah, for good [is] Thy kindness, According to the abundance Of Thy mercies turn Thou unto me,

<sup>17</sup> And hide not Thy face from Thy servant, For I am in distress — haste, answer me.

<sup>18</sup> Be near unto my soul — redeem it, Because of mine enemies ransom me.

<sup>19</sup> Thou — Thou hast known my reproach, And my shame, and my blushing, Before Thee [are] all mine adversaries.

<sup>20</sup> Reproach hath broken my heart, and I am sick, And I look for a bemoaner, and there is none, And for comforters, and I have found none.

<sup>21</sup> And they give for my food gall, And for my thirst cause me to drink vinegar.

<sup>22</sup> Their table before them is for a snare, And for a recompence — for a trap.

<sup>23</sup> Darkened are their eyes from seeing, And their loins continually shake Thou.

<sup>24</sup> Pour upon them Thine indignation, And the fierceness of Thine anger doth seize them.

<sup>25</sup> Their tower is desolated, In their tents there is no dweller.

<sup>26</sup> For they have pursued him Thou hast smitten, And recount of the pain of Thy pierced ones.

<sup>27</sup> Give punishment for their iniquity, And they enter not into Thy righteousness.

<sup>28</sup> They are blotted out of the book of life, And with the righteous are not written.

<sup>29</sup> And I [am] afflicted and pained, Thy salvation, O God, doth set me on high.

<sup>30</sup> I praise the name of God with a song, And I magnify Him with thanksgiving,

<sup>31</sup> And it is better to Jehovah than an ox, A bullock — horned — hoofed.

<sup>32</sup> The humble have seen — they rejoice, Ye who seek God — and your heart liveth.

<sup>33</sup> For Jehovah hearkeneth unto the needy, And His bound ones He hath not despised.

<sup>34</sup> The heavens and earth do praise Him, Seas, and every moving thing in them.

<sup>35</sup> For God doth save Zion, And doth build the cities of Judah, And they have dwelt there, and possess it.

<sup>36</sup> And the seed of His servants inherit it, And those loving His name dwell in it!
