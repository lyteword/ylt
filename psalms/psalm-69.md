# Psalm 69 

**¹** To the Overseer. — 'On the Lilies,' by David. Save me, O God, for come have waters unto the soul.

**²** I have sunk in deep mire, And there is no standing, I have come into the depths of the waters, And a flood hath overflown me.

**³** I have been wearied with my calling, Burnt hath been my throat, Consumed have been mine eyes, waiting for my God.

**⁴** Those hating me without cause Have been more than the hairs of my head, Mighty have been my destroyers, My lying enemies, That which I took not away — I bring back.

**⁵** O God, Thou — Thou hast known Concerning my overturn, And my desolations from Thee have not been hid.

**⁶** Let not those waiting on Thee be ashamed because of me, O Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, Let not those seeking Thee Blush because of me, O God of Israel.

**⁷** For because of Thee I have borne reproach, Shame hath covered my face.

**⁸** A stranger I have been to my brother, And a foreigner to sons of my mother.

**⁹** For zeal for Thy house hath consumed me, And the reproaches of Thy reproachers Have fallen upon me.

**¹⁰** And I weep in the fasting of my soul, And it is for a reproach to me.

**¹¹** And I make my clothing sackcloth, And I am to them for a simile.

**¹²** Those sitting at the gate meditate concerning me, And those drinking strong drink, Play on instruments.

**¹³** And I — my prayer [is] to Thee, O Jehovah, A time of good pleasure, O God, In the abundance of Thy kindness, Answer me in the truth of Thy salvation.

**¹⁴** Deliver me from the mire, and let me not sink, Let me be delivered from those hating me, And from deep places of waters.

**¹⁵** Let not a flood of waters overflow me, Nor let the deep swallow me up, Nor let the pit shut her mouth upon me.

**¹⁶** Answer me, O Jehovah, for good [is] Thy kindness, According to the abundance Of Thy mercies turn Thou unto me,

**¹⁷** And hide not Thy face from Thy servant, For I am in distress — haste, answer me.

**¹⁸** Be near unto my soul — redeem it, Because of mine enemies ransom me.

**¹⁹** Thou — Thou hast known my reproach, And my shame, and my blushing, Before Thee [are] all mine adversaries.

**²⁰** Reproach hath broken my heart, and I am sick, And I look for a bemoaner, and there is none, And for comforters, and I have found none.

**²¹** And they give for my food gall, And for my thirst cause me to drink vinegar.

**²²** Their table before them is for a snare, And for a recompence — for a trap.

**²³** Darkened are their eyes from seeing, And their loins continually shake Thou.

**²⁴** Pour upon them Thine indignation, And the fierceness of Thine anger doth seize them.

**²⁵** Their tower is desolated, In their tents there is no dweller.

**²⁶** For they have pursued him Thou hast smitten, And recount of the pain of Thy pierced ones.

**²⁷** Give punishment for their iniquity, And they enter not into Thy righteousness.

**²⁸** They are blotted out of the book of life, And with the righteous are not written.

**²⁹** And I [am] afflicted and pained, Thy salvation, O God, doth set me on high.

**³⁰** I praise the name of God with a song, And I magnify Him with thanksgiving,

**³¹** And it is better to Jehovah than an ox, A bullock — horned — hoofed.

**³²** The humble have seen — they rejoice, Ye who seek God — and your heart liveth.

**³³** For Jehovah hearkeneth unto the needy, And His bound ones He hath not despised.

**³⁴** The heavens and earth do praise Him, Seas, and every moving thing in them.

**³⁵** For God doth save Zion, And doth build the cities of Judah, And they have dwelt there, and possess it.

**³⁶** And the seed of His servants inherit it, And those loving His name dwell in it!
