# Psalm 13 

**¹** To the Overseer. — A Psalm of David. Till when, O Jehovah, Dost Thou forget me? — for ever? Till when dost Thou hide Thy face from me?

**²** Till when do I set counsels in my soul? Sorrow in my heart daily? Till when is mine enemy exalted over me?

**³** Look attentively; Answer me, O Jehovah, my God, Enlighten mine eyes, lest I sleep in death,

**⁴** Lest mine enemy say, 'I overcame him,' Mine adversaries joy when I am moved.

**⁵** And I, in Thy kindness I have trusted, Rejoice doth my heart in Thy salvation.

**⁶** I do sing to Jehovah, For He hath conferred benefits upon me!
