# Psalm 65

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer. — A Psalm of David. A Song. To Thee, silence — praise, O God, [is] in Zion, And to Thee is a vow completed.

<sup>2</sup> Hearer of prayer, to Thee all flesh cometh.

<sup>3</sup> Matters of iniquities were mightier than I, Our transgressions — Thou dost cover them.

<sup>4</sup> O the happiness of [him whom] Thou choosest, And drawest near, he inhabiteth Thy courts, We are satisfied with the goodness of Thy house, Thy holy temple.

<sup>5</sup> By fearful things in righteousness Thou answerest us, O God of our salvation, The confidence of all far off ends of earth and sea.

<sup>6</sup> Establishing mountains by His power, He hath been girded with might,

<sup>7</sup> Restraining the noise of seas, the noise of their billows, And the multitude of the peoples.

<sup>8</sup> And the inhabitants of the uttermost parts From Thy signs are afraid, The outgoings of morning and evening Thou causest to sing.

<sup>9</sup> Thou hast inspected the earth, and waterest it, Thou makest it very rich, the rivulet of God [is] full of water, Thou preparest their corn, When thus Thou dost prepare it,

<sup>10</sup> Its ridges have been filled, Deepened hath been its furrow, With showers Thou dost soften it, Its springing up Thou blessest.

<sup>11</sup> Thou hast crowned the year of Thy goodness, And Thy paths drop fatness.

<sup>12</sup> Drop do the pastures of a wilderness, And joy of the heights Thou girdest on.

<sup>13</sup> Clothed have lambs the flock, And valleys are covered with corn, They shout — yea, they sing!
