# Psalm 70

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer, by David. — 'To cause to remember.' O God, to deliver me, O Jehovah, for my help, haste.

<sup>2</sup> Let them be ashamed and confounded Who are seeking my soul, Let them be turned backward and blush Who are desiring my evil.

<sup>3</sup> Let them turn back because of their shame, Who are saying, 'Aha, aha.'

<sup>4</sup> Let all those seeking Thee joy and be glad in Thee, And let those loving Thy salvation Say continually, 'God is magnified.'

<sup>5</sup> And I [am] poor and needy, O God, haste to me, My help and my deliverer [art] Thou, O Jehovah, tarry Thou not!
