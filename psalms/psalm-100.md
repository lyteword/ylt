# Psalm 100

**¹** A Psalm of Thanksgiving. Shout to Jehovah, all the earth.

**²** Serve Jehovah with joy, come before him with singing.

**³** Know that Jehovah He [is] God, He made us, and we are His, His people — and the flock of His pasture.

**⁴** Enter ye His gates with thanksgiving, His courts with praise, Give ye thanks to Him, bless ye His Name.

**⁵** For good [is] Jehovah, to the age His kindness, And to generation and generation His faithfulness!
