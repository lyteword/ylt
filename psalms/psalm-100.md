# Psalm 100

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of Thanksgiving. Shout to Jehovah, all the earth.

<sup>2</sup> Serve Jehovah with joy, come before him with singing.

<sup>3</sup> Know that Jehovah He [is] God, He made us, and we are His, His people — and the flock of His pasture.

<sup>4</sup> Enter ye His gates with thanksgiving, His courts with praise, Give ye thanks to Him, bless ye His Name.

<sup>5</sup> For good [is] Jehovah, to the age His kindness, And to generation and generation His faithfulness!
