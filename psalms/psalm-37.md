# Psalm 37

**¹** By David. Do not fret because of evil doers, Be not envious against doers of iniquity,

**²** For as grass speedily they are cut off, And as the greenness of the tender grass do fade.

**³** Trust in Jehovah, and do good, Dwell [in] the land, and enjoy faithfulness,

**⁴** And delight thyself on Jehovah, And He giveth to thee the petitions of thy heart.

**⁵** Roll on Jehovah thy way, And trust upon Him, and He worketh,

**⁶** And hath brought out as light thy righteousness, And thy judgment as noon-day.

**⁷** Be silent for Jehovah, and stay thyself for Him, Do not fret because of him Who is making prosperous his way, Because of a man doing wicked devices.

**⁸** Desist from anger, and forsake fury, Fret not thyself only to do evil.

**⁹** For evil doers are cut off, As to those waiting on Jehovah, they possess the land.

**¹⁰** And yet a little, and the wicked is not, And thou hast considered his place, and it is not.

**¹¹** And the humble do possess the land, And they have delighted themselves In the abundance of peace.

**¹²** The wicked is devising against the righteous, And gnashing against him his teeth.

**¹³** The Lord doth laugh at him, For He hath seen that his day cometh.

**¹⁴** A sword have the wicked opened, And they have trodden their bow, To cause to fall the poor and needy, To slaughter the upright of the way.

**¹⁵** Their sword doth enter into their own heart, And their bows are shivered.

**¹⁶** Better [is] the little of the righteous, Than the store of many wicked.

**¹⁷** For the arms of the wicked are shivered, And Jehovah is sustaining the righteous.

**¹⁸** Jehovah knoweth the days of the perfect, And their inheritance is — to the age.

**¹⁹** They are not ashamed in a time of evil, And in days of famine they are satisfied.

**²⁰** But the wicked perish, and the enemies of Jehovah, As the preciousness of lambs, Have been consumed, In smoke they have been consumed.

**²¹** The wicked is borrowing and repayeth not, And the righteous is gracious and giving.

**²²** For His blessed ones do possess the land, And His reviled ones are cut off.

**²³** From Jehovah [are] the steps of a man, They have been prepared, And his way he desireth.

**²⁴** When he falleth, he is not cast down, For Jehovah is sustaining his hand.

**²⁵** Young I have been, I have also become old, And I have not seen the righteous forsaken, And his seed seeking bread.

**²⁶** All the day he is gracious and lending, And his seed [is] for a blessing.

**²⁷** Turn aside from evil, and do good, and dwell to the age.

**²⁸** For Jehovah is loving judgment, And He doth not forsake His saintly ones, To the age they have been kept, And the seed of the wicked is cut off.

**²⁹** The righteous possess the land, And they dwell for ever on it.

**³⁰** The mouth of the righteous uttereth wisdom, And his tongue speaketh judgment.

**³¹** The law of his God [is] his heart, His steps do not slide.

**³²** The wicked is watching for the righteous, And is seeking to put him to death.

**³³** Jehovah doth not leave him in his hand, Nor condemn him in his being judged.

**³⁴** Look unto Jehovah, and keep His way, And He doth exalt thee to possess the land, In the wicked being cut off — thou seest!

**³⁵** I have seen the wicked terrible, And spreading as a green native plant,

**³⁶** And he passeth away, and lo, he is not, And I seek him, and he is not found!

**³⁷** Observe the perfect, and see the upright, For the latter end of each [is] peace.

**³⁸** And transgressors were destroyed together, The latter end of the wicked was cut off.

**³⁹** And the salvation of the righteous [is] from Jehovah, Their strong place in a time of adversity.

**⁴⁰** And Jehovah doth help them and deliver them, He delivereth them from the wicked, And saveth them, Because they trusted in Him!
