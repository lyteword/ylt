# Psalm 37

<sup>1</sup> By David. Do not fret because of evil doers, Be not envious against doers of iniquity,

<sup>2</sup> For as grass speedily they are cut off, And as the greenness of the tender grass do fade.

<sup>3</sup> Trust in Jehovah, and do good, Dwell [in] the land, and enjoy faithfulness,

<sup>4</sup> And delight thyself on Jehovah, And He giveth to thee the petitions of thy heart.

<sup>5</sup> Roll on Jehovah thy way, And trust upon Him, and He worketh,

<sup>6</sup> And hath brought out as light thy righteousness, And thy judgment as noon-day.

<sup>7</sup> Be silent for Jehovah, and stay thyself for Him, Do not fret because of him Who is making prosperous his way, Because of a man doing wicked devices.

<sup>8</sup> Desist from anger, and forsake fury, Fret not thyself only to do evil.

<sup>9</sup> For evil doers are cut off, As to those waiting on Jehovah, they possess the land.

<sup>10</sup> And yet a little, and the wicked is not, And thou hast considered his place, and it is not.

<sup>11</sup> And the humble do possess the land, And they have delighted themselves In the abundance of peace.

<sup>12</sup> The wicked is devising against the righteous, And gnashing against him his teeth.

<sup>13</sup> The Lord doth laugh at him, For He hath seen that his day cometh.

<sup>14</sup> A sword have the wicked opened, And they have trodden their bow, To cause to fall the poor and needy, To slaughter the upright of the way.

<sup>15</sup> Their sword doth enter into their own heart, And their bows are shivered.

<sup>16</sup> Better [is] the little of the righteous, Than the store of many wicked.

<sup>17</sup> For the arms of the wicked are shivered, And Jehovah is sustaining the righteous.

<sup>18</sup> Jehovah knoweth the days of the perfect, And their inheritance is — to the age.

<sup>19</sup> They are not ashamed in a time of evil, And in days of famine they are satisfied.

<sup>20</sup> But the wicked perish, and the enemies of Jehovah, As the preciousness of lambs, Have been consumed, In smoke they have been consumed.

<sup>21</sup> The wicked is borrowing and repayeth not, And the righteous is gracious and giving.

<sup>22</sup> For His blessed ones do possess the land, And His reviled ones are cut off.

<sup>23</sup> From Jehovah [are] the steps of a man, They have been prepared, And his way he desireth.

<sup>24</sup> When he falleth, he is not cast down, For Jehovah is sustaining his hand.

<sup>25</sup> Young I have been, I have also become old, And I have not seen the righteous forsaken, And his seed seeking bread.

<sup>26</sup> All the day he is gracious and lending, And his seed [is] for a blessing.

<sup>27</sup> Turn aside from evil, and do good, and dwell to the age.

<sup>28</sup> For Jehovah is loving judgment, And He doth not forsake His saintly ones, To the age they have been kept, And the seed of the wicked is cut off.

<sup>29</sup> The righteous possess the land, And they dwell for ever on it.

<sup>30</sup> The mouth of the righteous uttereth wisdom, And his tongue speaketh judgment.

<sup>31</sup> The law of his God [is] his heart, His steps do not slide.

<sup>32</sup> The wicked is watching for the righteous, And is seeking to put him to death.

<sup>33</sup> Jehovah doth not leave him in his hand, Nor condemn him in his being judged.

<sup>34</sup> Look unto Jehovah, and keep His way, And He doth exalt thee to possess the land, In the wicked being cut off — thou seest!

<sup>35</sup> I have seen the wicked terrible, And spreading as a green native plant,

<sup>36</sup> And he passeth away, and lo, he is not, And I seek him, and he is not found!

<sup>37</sup> Observe the perfect, and see the upright, For the latter end of each [is] peace.

<sup>38</sup> And transgressors were destroyed together, The latter end of the wicked was cut off.

<sup>39</sup> And the salvation of the righteous [is] from Jehovah, Their strong place in a time of adversity.

<sup>40</sup> And Jehovah doth help them and deliver them, He delivereth them from the wicked, And saveth them, Because they trusted in Him!
