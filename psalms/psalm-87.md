# Psalm 87

**¹** By sons of Korah. — A Psalm, a song. His foundation [is] in holy mountains.

**²** Jehovah is loving the gates of Zion Above all the tabernacles of Jacob.

**³** Honourable things are spoken in Thee, O city of God. Selah.

**⁴** I mention Rahab and Babel to those knowing Me, Lo, Philistia, and Tyre, with Cush! This [one] was born there.

**⁵** And of Zion it is said: Each one was born in her, And He, the Most High, doth establish her.

**⁶** Jehovah doth recount in the describing of the peoples, 'This [one] was born there.' Selah.

**⁷** Singers also as players on instruments, All my fountains [are] in Thee!
