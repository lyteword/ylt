# Psalm 139

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer. — A Psalm by David. Jehovah, Thou hast searched me, and knowest.

<sup>2</sup> Thou — Thou hast known my sitting down, And my rising up, Thou hast attended to my thoughts from afar.

<sup>3</sup> My path and my couch Thou hast fanned, And [with] all my ways hast been acquainted.

<sup>4</sup> For there is not a word in my tongue, Lo, O Jehovah, Thou hast known it all!

<sup>5</sup> Behind and before Thou hast besieged me, And Thou dost place on me Thy hand.

<sup>6</sup> Knowledge too wonderful for me, It hath been set on high, I am not able for it.

<sup>7</sup> Whither do I go from Thy Spirit? And whither from Thy face do I flee?

<sup>8</sup> If I ascend the heavens — there Thou [art], And spread out a couch in Sheol, lo, Thee!

<sup>9</sup> I take the wings of morning, I dwell in the uttermost part of the sea,

<sup>10</sup> Also there Thy hand doth lead me, And Thy right hand doth hold me.

<sup>11</sup> And I say, 'Surely darkness bruiseth me, Then night [is] light to me.

<sup>12</sup> Also darkness hideth not from Thee, And night as day shineth, as [is] darkness so [is] light.

<sup>13</sup> For Thou — Thou hast possessed my reins, Thou dost cover me in my mother's belly.

<sup>14</sup> I confess Thee, because that [with] wonders I have been distinguished. Wonderful [are] Thy works, And my soul is knowing [it] well.

<sup>15</sup> My substance was not hid from Thee, When I was made in secret, Curiously wrought in the lower part of earth.

<sup>16</sup> Mine unformed substance Thine eyes saw, And on Thy book all of them are written, The days they were formed — And not one among them.

<sup>17</sup> And to me how precious have been Thy thoughts, O God, how great hath been their sum!

<sup>18</sup> I recount them! than the sand they are more, I have waked, and I am still with Thee.

<sup>19</sup> Dost Thou slay, O God, the wicked? Then, men of blood, turn aside from me!

<sup>20</sup> Who exchange Thee for wickedness, Lifted up to vanity [are] Thine enemies.

<sup>21</sup> Do not I hate, Jehovah, those hating Thee? And with Thy withstanders grieve myself?

<sup>22</sup> [With] perfect hatred I have hated them, Enemies they have become to me.

<sup>23</sup> Search me, O God, and know my heart, Try me, and know my thoughts,

<sup>24</sup> And see if a grievous way be in me, And lead me in a way age-during!
