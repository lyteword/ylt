# Psalm 81

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer. — 'On the Gittith.' By Asaph. Cry aloud to God our strength, Shout to the God of Jacob.

<sup>2</sup> Lift up a song, and give out a timbrel, A pleasant harp with psaltery.

<sup>3</sup> Blow in the month a trumpet, In the new moon, at the day of our festival,

<sup>4</sup> For a statute to Israel it [is], An ordinance of the God of Jacob.

<sup>5</sup> A testimony on Joseph He hath placed it, In his going forth over the land of Egypt. A lip, I have not known — I hear.

<sup>6</sup> From the burden his shoulder I turned aside, His hands from the basket pass over.

<sup>7</sup> In distress thou hast called and I deliver thee, I answer thee in the secret place of thunder, I try thee by the waters of Meribah. Selah.

<sup>8</sup> Hear, O My people, and I testify to thee, O Israel, if thou dost hearken to me:

<sup>9</sup> There is not in thee a strange god, And thou bowest not thyself to a strange god.

<sup>10</sup> I [am] Jehovah thy God, Who bringeth thee up out of the land of Egypt. Enlarge thy mouth, and I fill it.

<sup>11</sup> But, My people hearkened not to My voice, And Israel hath not consented to Me.

<sup>12</sup> And I send them away in the enmity of their heart, They walk in their own counsels.

<sup>13</sup> O that My people were hearkening to Me, Israel in My ways would walk.

<sup>14</sup> As a little thing their enemies I cause to bow, And against their adversaries I turn back My hand,

<sup>15</sup> Those hating Jehovah feign obedience to Him, But their time is — to the age.

<sup>16</sup> He causeth him to eat of the fat of wheat, And [with] honey from a rock I satisfy thee!
