# Psalm 83

<sup>1</sup> A Song, — A Psalm of Asaph. O God, let there be no silence to Thee, Be not silent, nor be quiet, O God.

<sup>2</sup> For, lo, Thine enemies do roar, And those hating Thee have lifted up the head,

<sup>3</sup> Against Thy people they take crafty counsel, And consult against Thy hidden ones.

<sup>4</sup> They have said, 'Come, And we cut them off from [being] a nation, And the name of Israel is not remembered any more.'

<sup>5</sup> For they consulted in heart together, Against Thee a covenant they make,

<sup>6</sup> Tents of Edom, and Ishmaelites, Moab, and the Hagarenes,

<sup>7</sup> Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek, Philistia with inhabitants of Tyre,

<sup>8</sup> Asshur also is joined with them, They have been an arm to sons of Lot. Selah.

<sup>9</sup> Do to them as [to] Midian, As [to] Sisera, as [to] Jabin, at the stream Kishon.

<sup>10</sup> They were destroyed at Endor, They were dung for the ground!

<sup>11</sup> Make their nobles as Oreb and as Zeeb, And as Zebah and Zalmunna all their princes,

<sup>12</sup> Who have said, 'Let us occupy for ourselves The comely places of God.'

<sup>13</sup> O my God, make them as a rolling thing, As stubble before wind.

<sup>14</sup> As a fire doth burn a forest, And as a flame setteth hills on fire,

<sup>15</sup> So dost Thou pursue them with Thy whirlwind, And with Thy hurricane troublest them.

<sup>16</sup> Fill their faces [with] shame, And they seek Thy name, O Jehovah.

<sup>17</sup> They are ashamed and troubled for ever, Yea, they are confounded and lost.

<sup>18</sup> And they know that Thou — (Thy name [is] Jehovah — by Thyself,) [Art] the Most High over all the earth!
