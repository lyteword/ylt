# Psalm 141 

**¹** A Psalm, by David. O Jehovah, I have called Thee, haste to me, Give ear [to] my voice when I call to Thee.

**²** My prayer is prepared — incense before Thee, The lifting up of my hands — the evening present.

**³** Set, O Jehovah, a watch for my mouth, Watch Thou over the door of my lips.

**⁴** Incline not my heart to an evil thing, To do habitually actions in wickedness, With men working iniquity, Yea, I eat not of their pleasant things.

**⁵** The righteous doth beat me [in] kindness. And doth reprove me, Oil of the head my head disalloweth not, For still my prayer [is] about their vexations.

**⁶** Their judges have been released by the sides of a rock, And they have heard my sayings, For they have been pleasant.

**⁷** As one tilling and ripping up in the land, Have our bones been scattered at the command of Saul.

**⁸** But to Thee, O Jehovah, my Lord, [are] mine eyes, In Thee I have trusted, Make not bare my soul.

**⁹** Keep me from the gin they laid for me, Even snares of workers of iniquity.

**¹⁰** The wicked fall in their nets together, till I pass over!
