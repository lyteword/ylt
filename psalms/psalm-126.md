# Psalm 126

**¹** A Song of the Ascents. In Jehovah's turning back [to] the captivity of Zion, We have been as dreamers.

**²** Then filled [with] laughter is our mouth, And our tongue [with] singing, Then do they say among nations, 'Jehovah did great things with these.'

**³** Jehovah did great things with us, We have been joyful.

**⁴** Turn again, O Jehovah, [to] our captivity, As streams in the south.

**⁵** Those sowing in tears, with singing do reap,

**⁶** Whoso goeth on and weepeth, Bearing the basket of seed, Surely cometh in with singing, bearing his sheaves!
