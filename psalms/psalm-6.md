# Psalm 6

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer with stringed instruments, on the octave. — A Psalm of David. O Jehovah, in Thine anger reprove me not, Nor in Thy fury chastise me.

<sup>2</sup> Favour me, O Jehovah, for I [am] weak, Heal me, O Jehovah, For troubled have been my bones,

<sup>3</sup> And my soul hath been troubled greatly, And Thou, O Jehovah, till when?

<sup>4</sup> Turn back, O Jehovah, draw out my soul, Save me for Thy kindness' sake.

<sup>5</sup> For there is not in death Thy memorial, In Sheol, who doth give thanks to Thee?

<sup>6</sup> I have been weary with my sighing, I meditate through all the night [on] my bed, With my tear my couch I waste.

<sup>7</sup> Old from provocation is mine eye, It is old because of all mine adversaries,

<sup>8</sup> Turn from me all ye workers of iniquity, For Jehovah heard the voice of my weeping,

<sup>9</sup> Jehovah hath heard my supplication, Jehovah my prayer receiveth.

<sup>10</sup> Ashamed and troubled greatly are all mine enemies, They turn back — ashamed [in] a moment!
