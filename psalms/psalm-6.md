# Psalm 6

**¹** To the Overseer with stringed instruments, on the octave. — A Psalm of David. O Jehovah, in Thine anger reprove me not, Nor in Thy fury chastise me.

**²** Favour me, O Jehovah, for I [am] weak, Heal me, O Jehovah, For troubled have been my bones,

**³** And my soul hath been troubled greatly, And Thou, O Jehovah, till when?

**⁴** Turn back, O Jehovah, draw out my soul, Save me for Thy kindness' sake.

**⁵** For there is not in death Thy memorial, In Sheol, who doth give thanks to Thee?

**⁶** I have been weary with my sighing, I meditate through all the night [on] my bed, With my tear my couch I waste.

**⁷** Old from provocation is mine eye, It is old because of all mine adversaries,

**⁸** Turn from me all ye workers of iniquity, For Jehovah heard the voice of my weeping,

**⁹** Jehovah hath heard my supplication, Jehovah my prayer receiveth.

**¹⁰** Ashamed and troubled greatly are all mine enemies, They turn back — ashamed [in] a moment!
