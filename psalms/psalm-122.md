# Psalm 122

<sup>1</sup> A Song of the Ascents, by David. I have rejoiced in those saying to me, 'To the house of Jehovah we go.'

<sup>2</sup> Our feet have been standing in thy gates, O Jerusalem!

<sup>3</sup> Jerusalem — the builded one — [Is] as a city that is joined to itself together.

<sup>4</sup> For thither have tribes gone up, Tribes of Jah, companies of Israel, To give thanks to the name of Jehovah.

<sup>5</sup> For there have sat thrones of judgment, Thrones of the house of David.

<sup>6</sup> Ask ye the peace of Jerusalem, At rest are those loving thee.

<sup>7</sup> Peace is in thy bulwark, rest in thy high places,

<sup>8</sup> For the sake of my brethren and my companions, Let me speak, I pray thee, 'Peace [be] in thee.'

<sup>9</sup> For the sake of the house of Jehovah our God, I seek good for thee!
