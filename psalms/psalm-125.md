# Psalm 125

<sup>1</sup> A Song of the Ascents. Those trusting in Jehovah [are] as Mount Zion, It is not moved — to the age it abideth.

<sup>2</sup> Jerusalem! mountains [are] round about her, And Jehovah [is] round about His people, From henceforth even unto the age.

<sup>3</sup> For the rod of wickedness resteth not On the lot of the righteous, That the righteous put not forth on iniquity their hands.

<sup>4</sup> Do good, O Jehovah, to the good, And to the upright in their hearts.

<sup>5</sup> As to those turning [to] their crooked ways, Jehovah causeth them to go with workers of iniquity. Peace on Israel!
