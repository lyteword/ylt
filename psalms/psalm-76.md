# Psalm 76

**¹** To the Overseer with stringed instruments. — A Psalm of Asaph. — A Song. In Judah [is] God known, in Israel His name [is] great.

**²** And His tabernacle is in Salem, And His habitation in Zion.

**³** There he hath shivered arrows of a bow, Shield, and sword, and battle. Selah.

**⁴** Bright [art] Thou, honourable above hills of prey.

**⁵** Spoiled themselves have the mighty of heart, They have slept their sleep, And none of the men of might found their hands.

**⁶** From Thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both rider and horse have been fast asleep.

**⁷** Thou, fearful [art] Thou, And who doth stand before Thee, Since Thou hast been angry!

**⁸** From heaven Thou hast sounded judgment, Earth hath feared, and hath been still,

**⁹** In the rising of God to judgment, To save all the humble of earth. Selah.

**¹⁰** For the fierceness of man praiseth Thee, The remnant of fierceness Thou girdest on.

**¹¹** Vow and complete to Jehovah your God, All ye surrounding him. They bring presents to the Fearful One.

**¹²** He doth gather the spirit of leaders, Fearful to the kings of earth!
