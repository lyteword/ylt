# Psalm 120

<sup>1</sup> A Song of the Ascents. Unto Jehovah in my distress I have called, And He answereth me.

<sup>2</sup> O Jehovah, deliver my soul from a lying lip, From a deceitful tongue!

<sup>3</sup> What doth He give to thee? And what doth He add to thee? O deceitful tongue!

<sup>4</sup> Sharp arrows of a mighty one, with broom-coals.

<sup>5</sup> Woe to me, for I have inhabited Mesech, I have dwelt with tents of Kedar.

<sup>6</sup> Too much hath my soul dwelt with him who is hating peace.

<sup>7</sup> I [am] peace, and when I speak they [are] for war!
