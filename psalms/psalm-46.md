# Psalm 46

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer. — By sons of Korah. 'For the Virgins.' — A song. God [is] to us a refuge and strength, A help in adversities found most surely.

<sup>2</sup> Therefore we fear not in the changing of earth, And in the slipping of mountains Into the heart of the seas.

<sup>3</sup> Roar — troubled are its waters, Mountains they shake in its pride. Selah.

<sup>4</sup> A river — its rivulets rejoice the city of God, Thy holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.

<sup>5</sup> God [is] in her midst — she is not moved, God doth help her at the turn of the morn!

<sup>6</sup> Troubled have been nations, Moved have been kingdoms, He hath given forth with His voice, earth melteth.

<sup>7</sup> Jehovah of Hosts [is] with us, A tower for us [is] the God of Jacob. Selah.

<sup>8</sup> Come ye, see the works of Jehovah, Who hath done astonishing things in the earth,

<sup>9</sup> Causing wars to cease, Unto the end of the earth, the bow he shivereth, And the spear He hath cut asunder, Chariots he doth burn with fire.

<sup>10</sup> Desist, and know that I [am] God, I am exalted among nations, I am exalted in the earth.

<sup>11</sup> Jehovah of hosts [is] with us, A tower for us [is] the God of Jacob! Selah.
