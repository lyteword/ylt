# Psalm 31

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer. — A Psalm of David. In Thee, O Jehovah, I have trusted, Let me not be ashamed to the age, In Thy righteousness deliver me.

<sup>2</sup> Incline unto me Thine ear hastily, deliver me, Be to me for a strong rock, For a house of bulwarks to save me.

<sup>3</sup> For my rock and my bulwark [art] Thou, For Thy name's sake lead me and tend me.

<sup>4</sup> Bring me out from the net that they hid for me, For Thou [art] my strength.

<sup>5</sup> Into Thy hand I commit my spirit, Thou hast redeemed me, Jehovah God of truth.

<sup>6</sup> I have hated the observers of lying vanities, And I toward Jehovah have been confident.

<sup>7</sup> I rejoice, and am glad in Thy kindness, In that Thou hast seen mine affliction, Thou hast known in adversities my soul.

<sup>8</sup> And Thou hast not shut me up, Into the hand of an enemy, Thou hast caused my feet to stand in a broad place.

<sup>9</sup> Favour me, O Jehovah, for distress [is] to me, Mine eye, my soul, and my body Have become old by provocation.

<sup>10</sup> For my life hath been consumed in sorrow And my years in sighing. Feeble because of mine iniquity hath been my strength, And my bones have become old.

<sup>11</sup> Among all mine adversaries I have been a reproach, And to my neighbours exceedingly, And a fear to mine acquaintances, Those seeing me without — fled from me.

<sup>12</sup> I have been forgotten as dead out of mind, I have been as a perishing vessel.

<sup>13</sup> For I have heard an evil account of many, Fear [is] round about. In their being united against me, To take my life they have devised,

<sup>14</sup> And I on Thee — I have trusted, O Jehovah, I have said, 'Thou [art] my God.'

<sup>15</sup> In Thy hand [are] my times, Deliver me from the hand of my enemies, And from my pursuers.

<sup>16</sup> Cause Thy face to shine on Thy servant, Save me in Thy kindness.

<sup>17</sup> O Jehovah, let me not be ashamed, For I have called Thee, let the wicked be ashamed, Let them become silent to Sheol.

<sup>18</sup> Let lips of falsehood become dumb, That are speaking against the righteous, Ancient sayings, in pride and contempt.

<sup>19</sup> How abundant is Thy goodness, That Thou hast laid up for those fearing Thee,

<sup>20</sup> Thou hast wrought for those trusting in Thee, Before sons of men. Thou hidest them in the secret place of Thy presence, From artifices of man, Thou concealest them in a tabernacle, From the strife of tongues.

<sup>21</sup> Blessed [is] Jehovah, For He hath made marvellous His kindness To me in a city of bulwarks.

<sup>22</sup> And I — I have said in my haste, 'I have been cut off from before Thine eyes,' But Thou hast heard the voice of my supplications, In my crying unto Thee.

<sup>23</sup> Love Jehovah, all ye His saints, Jehovah is keeping the faithful, And recompensing abundantly a proud doer.

<sup>24</sup> Be strong, and He strengtheneth your heart, All ye who are waiting for Jehovah!
