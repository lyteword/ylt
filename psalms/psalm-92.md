# Psalm 92

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm. — A Song for the sabbath-day. Good to give thanks to Jehovah, And to sing praises to Thy name, O Most High,

<sup>2</sup> To declare in the morning Thy kindness, And Thy faithfulness in the nights.

<sup>3</sup> On ten strings and on psaltery, On higgaion, with harp.

<sup>4</sup> For Thou hast caused me to rejoice, O Jehovah, in Thy work, Concerning the works of Thy hands I sing.

<sup>5</sup> How great have been Thy works, O Jehovah, Very deep have been Thy thoughts.

<sup>6</sup> A brutish man doth not know, And a fool understandeth not this; —

<sup>7</sup> When the wicked flourish as a herb, And blossom do all workers of iniquity — For their being destroyed for ever and ever!

<sup>8</sup> And Thou [art] high to the age, O Jehovah.

<sup>9</sup> For, lo, Thine enemies, O Jehovah, For, lo, Thine enemies, do perish, Separate themselves do all workers of iniquity.

<sup>10</sup> And Thou exaltest as a reem my horn, I have been anointed with fresh oil.

<sup>11</sup> And mine eye looketh on mine enemies, Of those rising up against me, The evil doers, do mine ears hear.

<sup>12</sup> The righteous as a palm-tree flourisheth, As a cedar in Lebanon he groweth.

<sup>13</sup> Those planted in the house of Jehovah, In the courts of our God do flourish.

<sup>14</sup> Still they bring forth in old age, Fat and flourishing are they,

<sup>15</sup> To declare that upright [is] Jehovah my rock, And there is no perverseness in Him!
