# Psalm 23

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. Jehovah [is] my shepherd, I do not lack,

<sup>2</sup> In pastures of tender grass He causeth me to lie down, By quiet waters He doth lead me.

<sup>3</sup> My soul He refresheth, He leadeth me in paths of righteousness, For His name's sake,

<sup>4</sup> Also — when I walk in a valley of death-shade, I fear no evil, for Thou [art] with me, Thy rod and Thy staff — they comfort me.

<sup>5</sup> Thou arrangest before me a table, Over-against my adversaries, Thou hast anointed with oil my head, My cup is full!

<sup>6</sup> Only — goodness and kindness pursue me, All the days of my life, And my dwelling [is] in the house of Jehovah, For a length of days!
