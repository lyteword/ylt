# Psalm 23 

**¹** A Psalm of David. Jehovah [is] my shepherd, I do not lack,

**²** In pastures of tender grass He causeth me to lie down, By quiet waters He doth lead me.

**³** My soul He refresheth, He leadeth me in paths of righteousness, For His name's sake,

**⁴** Also — when I walk in a valley of death-shade, I fear no evil, for Thou [art] with me, Thy rod and Thy staff — they comfort me.

**⁵** Thou arrangest before me a table, Over-against my adversaries, Thou hast anointed with oil my head, My cup is full!

**⁶** Only — goodness and kindness pursue me, All the days of my life, And my dwelling [is] in the house of Jehovah, For a length of days!
