# Psalm 64

**¹** To the Overseer. — A Psalm of David. Hear, O God, my voice, in my meditation, From the fear of an enemy Thou keepest my life,

**²** Hidest me from the secret counsel of evil doers, From the tumult of workers of iniquity.

**³** Who sharpened as a sword their tongue, They directed their arrow — a bitter word.

**⁴** To shoot in secret places the perfect, Suddenly they shoot him, and fear not.

**⁵** They strengthen for themselves an evil thing, They recount of the hiding of snares, They have said, 'Who doth look at it?'

**⁶** They search out perverse things, 'We perfected a searching search,' And the inward part of man, and the heart [are] deep.

**⁷** And God doth shoot them [with] an arrow, Sudden have been their wounds,

**⁸** And they cause him to stumble, Against them [is] their own tongue, Every looker on them fleeth away.

**⁹** And all men fear, and declare the work of God, And His deed they have considered wisely.

**¹⁰** The righteous doth rejoice in Jehovah, And hath trusted in Him, And boast themselves do all the upright of heart!
