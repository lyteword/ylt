# Psalm 8

<sup>1</sup> To the Overseer, 'On the Gittith.' A Psalm of David. Jehovah, our Lord, How honourable Thy name in all the earth! Who settest thine honour on the heavens.

<sup>2</sup> From the mouths of infants and sucklings Thou hast founded strength, Because of Thine adversaries, To still an enemy and a self-avenger.

<sup>3</sup> For I see Thy heavens, a work of Thy fingers, Moon and stars that Thou didst establish.

<sup>4</sup> What [is] man that Thou rememberest him? The son of man that Thou inspectest him?

<sup>5</sup> And causest him to lack a little of Godhead, And with honour and majesty compassest him.

<sup>6</sup> Thou dost cause him to rule Over the works of Thy hands, All Thou hast placed under his feet.

<sup>7</sup> Sheep and oxen, all of them, And also beasts of the field,

<sup>8</sup> Bird of the heavens, and fish of the sea, Passing through the paths of the seas!

<sup>9</sup> Jehovah, our Lord, How honourable Thy name in all the earth!
