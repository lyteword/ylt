# Psalm 8

**¹** To the Overseer, 'On the Gittith.' A Psalm of David. Jehovah, our Lord, How honourable Thy name in all the earth! Who settest thine honour on the heavens.

**²** From the mouths of infants and sucklings Thou hast founded strength, Because of Thine adversaries, To still an enemy and a self-avenger.

**³** For I see Thy heavens, a work of Thy fingers, Moon and stars that Thou didst establish.

**⁴** What [is] man that Thou rememberest him? The son of man that Thou inspectest him?

**⁵** And causest him to lack a little of Godhead, And with honour and majesty compassest him.

**⁶** Thou dost cause him to rule Over the works of Thy hands, All Thou hast placed under his feet.

**⁷** Sheep and oxen, all of them, And also beasts of the field,

**⁸** Bird of the heavens, and fish of the sea, Passing through the paths of the seas!

**⁹** Jehovah, our Lord, How honourable Thy name in all the earth!
