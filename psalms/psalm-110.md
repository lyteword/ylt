# Psalm 110

<sup>1</sup> A Psalm of David. The affirmation of Jehovah to my Lord: 'Sit at My right hand, Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.'

<sup>2</sup> The rod of thy strength doth Jehovah send from Zion, Rule in the midst of thine enemies.

<sup>3</sup> Thy people [are] free-will gifts in the day of Thy strength, in the honours of holiness, From the womb, from the morning, Thou hast the dew of thy youth.

<sup>4</sup> Jehovah hath sworn, and doth not repent, 'Thou [art] a priest to the age, According to the order of Melchizedek.'

<sup>5</sup> The Lord on thy right hand smote kings In the day of His anger.

<sup>6</sup> He doth judge among the nations, He hath completed the carcases, Hath smitten the head over the mighty earth.

<sup>7</sup> From a brook in the way he drinketh, Therefore he doth lift up the head!
