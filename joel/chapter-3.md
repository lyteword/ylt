# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> For lo, in those days, and in that time, When I turn back [to] the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,

<sup>2</sup> Then I have gathered all the nations, And caused them to go down unto the valley of Jehoshaphat, And I have been judged with them there, Concerning My people and Mine inheritance — Israel, Whom they scattered among nations, And My land they have apportioned.

<sup>3</sup> And for My people they do cast a lot, And they give the young man for an harlot, And the young woman have sold for wine, That they may drink.

<sup>4</sup> And also, what [are] ye to Me, O Tyre and Zidon, And all circuits of Philistia? Recompence are ye rendering unto Me? And if ye are giving recompence to Me, Swiftly, hastily, I turn back your recompence on your head.

<sup>5</sup> In that My silver and My gold ye took, And My desirable things that are good, Ye have brought in to your temples.

<sup>6</sup> And sons of Judah, and sons of Jerusalem, Ye have sold to the sons of Javan, To put them far off from their border.

<sup>7</sup> Lo, I am stirring them up out of the place Whither ye have sold them, And I have turned back your recompence on your head,

<sup>8</sup> And have sold your sons and your daughters Into the hand of the sons of Judah, And they have sold them to Shabeans, Unto a nation far off, for Jehovah hath spoken.

<sup>9</sup> Proclaim ye this among nations, Sanctify a war, stir up the mighty ones, Come nigh, come up, let all the men of war.

<sup>10</sup> Beat your ploughshares to swords, And your pruning-hooks to javelins, Let the weak say, 'I [am] mighty.'

<sup>11</sup> Haste, and come in, all ye nations round, And be gathered together, Thither cause to come down, O Jehovah, Thy mighty ones.

<sup>12</sup> Wake and come up let the nations unto the valley of Jehoshaphat, For there I sit to judge all the nations around.

<sup>13</sup> Send ye forth a sickle, For ripened hath harvest, Come in, come down, for filled hath been the press, Overflowed hath wine-presses, For great [is] their wickedness.

<sup>14</sup> Multitudes, multitudes [are] in the valley of decision, For near [is] the day of Jehovah in the valley of decision.

<sup>15</sup> Sun and moon have been black, And stars have gathered up their shining.

<sup>16</sup> And Jehovah from Zion doth roar, And from Jerusalem giveth forth His voice, And shaken have the heavens and earth, And Jehovah [is] a refuge to his people, And a stronghold to sons of Israel.

<sup>17</sup> And ye have known that I [am] Jehovah your God, Dwelling in Zion, My holy mountain, And Jerusalem hath been holy, And strangers do not pass over into it again.

<sup>18</sup> And it hath come to pass, in that day, Drop down do the mountains juice, And the hills do flow [with] milk, And all streams of Judah do go [with] water, And a fountain from the house of Jehovah goeth forth, And hath watered the valley of Shittim.

<sup>19</sup> Egypt a desolation becometh, And Edom a desolation, a wilderness, becometh, For violence [to] sons of Judah, Whose innocent blood they shed in their land.

<sup>20</sup> And Judah to the age doth dwell, And Jerusalem to generation and generation.

<sup>21</sup> And I have declared their blood innocent, [That] I did not declare innocent, And Jehovah is dwelling in Zion!
