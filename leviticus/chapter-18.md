# Chapter 18

<sup>1</sup> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,

<sup>2</sup> 'Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, I [am] Jehovah your God;

<sup>3</sup> according to the work of the land of Egypt in which ye have dwelt ye do not, and according to the work of the land of Canaan whither I am bringing you in, ye do not, and in their statutes ye walk not.

<sup>4</sup> 'My judgments ye do, and My statutes ye keep, to walk in them; I [am] Jehovah your God;

<sup>5</sup> and ye have kept My statutes and My judgments which man doth and liveth in them; I [am] Jehovah.

<sup>6</sup> 'None of you unto any relation of his flesh doth draw near to uncover nakedness; I [am] Jehovah.

<sup>7</sup> 'The nakedness of thy father and the nakedness of thy mother thou dost not uncover, she [is] thy mother; thou dost not uncover her nakedness.

<sup>8</sup> 'The nakedness of the wife of thy father thou dost not uncover; it [is] the nakedness of thy father.

<sup>9</sup> 'The nakedness of thy sister, daughter of thy father, or daughter of thy mother, born at home or born without; thou dost not uncover their nakedness.

<sup>10</sup> 'The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter: thou dost not uncover their nakedness; for theirs [is] thy nakedness.

<sup>11</sup> 'The nakedness of a daughter of thy father's wife, begotten of thy father, she [is] thy sister; thou dost not uncover her nakedness.

<sup>12</sup> 'The nakedness of a sister of thy father thou dost not uncover; she [is] a relation of thy father.

<sup>13</sup> 'The nakedness of thy mother's sister thou dost not uncover; for she [is] thy mother's relation.

<sup>14</sup> 'The nakedness of thy father's brother thou dost not uncover; unto his wife thou dost not draw near; she [is] thine aunt.

<sup>15</sup> 'The nakedness of thy daughter-in-law thou dost not uncover; she [is] thy son's wife; thou dost not uncover her nakedness.

<sup>16</sup> 'The nakedness of thy brother's wife thou dost not uncover; it [is] thy brother's nakedness.

<sup>17</sup> 'The nakedness of a woman and her daughter thou dost not uncover; her son's daughter, and her daughter's daughter thou dost not take to uncover her nakedness; they [are] her relations; it [is] wickedness.

<sup>18</sup> 'And a woman unto another thou dost not take, to be an adversary, to uncover her nakedness beside her, in her life.

<sup>19</sup> 'And unto a woman in the separation of her uncleanness thou dost not draw near to uncover her nakedness.

<sup>20</sup> 'And unto the wife of thy fellow thou dost not give thy seed of copulation, for uncleanness with her.

<sup>21</sup> 'And of thy seed thou dost not give to pass over to the Molech; nor dost thou pollute the name of thy God; I [am] Jehovah.

<sup>22</sup> 'And with a male thou dost not lie as one lieth with a woman; abomination it [is].

<sup>23</sup> 'And with any beast thou dost not give thy copulation, for uncleanness with it; and a woman doth not stand before a beast to lie down with it; confusion it [is].

<sup>24</sup> 'Ye are not defiled with all these, for with all these have the nations been defiled which I am sending away from before you;

<sup>25</sup> and the land is defiled, and I charge its iniquity upon it, and the land vomiteth out its inhabitants:

<sup>26</sup> and ye — ye have kept My statutes and My judgments, and do not [any] of all these abominations, the native and the sojourner who is sojourning in your midst,

<sup>27</sup> (for all these abominations have the men of the land done who [are] before you, and the land is defiled),

<sup>28</sup> and the land doth not vomit you out in your defiling it, as it hath vomited out the nation which [is] before you;

<sup>29</sup> for any one who doth [any] of all these abominations — even the persons who are doing [so], have been cut off from the midst of their people;

<sup>30</sup> and ye have kept My charge, so as not to do [any] of the abominable statutes which have been done before you, and ye do not defile yourselves with them; I [am] Jehovah your God.'
