# Chapter 24

<sup>1</sup> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,

<sup>2</sup> 'Command the sons of Israel, and they bring unto thee pure olive oil, beaten, for the lamp, to cause a light to go up continually;

<sup>3</sup> at the outside of the vail of the testimony in the tent of meeting doth Aaron arrange it from evening till morning before Jehovah continually — a statute age-during to your generations;

<sup>4</sup> by the pure candlestick he doth arrange the lights before Jehovah continually.

<sup>5</sup> 'And thou hast taken flour, and hast baked twelve cakes with it, two tenth deals are in the one cake,

<sup>6</sup> and thou hast set them two ranks (six in the rank) on the pure table before Jehovah,

<sup>7</sup> and thou hast put on the rank pure frankincense, and it hath been to the bread for a memorial, a fire-offering to Jehovah.

<sup>8</sup> 'On each sabbath-day he arrangeth it before Jehovah continually, from the sons of Israel — a covenant age-during;

<sup>9</sup> and it hath been to Aaron, and to his sons, and they have eaten it in the holy place, for it [is] most holy to him, from the fire-offerings of Jehovah — a statute age-during.'

<sup>10</sup> And a son of an Israelitish woman goeth out (and he [is] son of an Egyptian man), in the midst of the sons of Israel, and strive in the camp do the son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel,

<sup>11</sup> and the son of the Israelitish woman execrateth the Name, and revileth; and they bring him in unto Moses; and his mother's name [is] Shelomith daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan;

<sup>12</sup> and he causeth him to rest in charge — to explain to them by the mouth of Jehovah.

<sup>13</sup> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,

<sup>14</sup> 'Bring out the reviler unto the outside of the camp; and all those hearing have laid their hands on his head, and all the company have stoned him.

<sup>15</sup> 'And unto the sons of Israel thou dost speak, saying, When any man revileth his God — then he hath borne his sin;

<sup>16</sup> and he who is execrating the name of Jehovah is certainly put to death; all the company do certainly cast stones at him; as a sojourner so a native, in his execrating the Name, is put to death.

<sup>17</sup> 'And when a man smiteth any soul of man, he is certainly put to death.

<sup>18</sup> 'And he who smiteth a beast repayeth it, body for body.

<sup>19</sup> 'And when a man putteth a blemish in his fellow, as he hath done so it is done to him;

<sup>20</sup> breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he putteth a blemish in a man so it is done in him.

<sup>21</sup> 'And he who smiteth a beast repayeth it, and he who smiteth [the life of] man is put to death;

<sup>22</sup> one judgment is to you; as a sojourner so is a native; for I [am] Jehovah your God.'

<sup>23</sup> And Moses speaketh unto the sons of Israel, and they bring out the reviler unto the outside of the camp, and stone him with stones; and the sons of Israel have done as Jehovah hath commanded Moses.
