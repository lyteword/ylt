<sup>3</sup> from a son of twenty years and upward, every one going out to the host in Israel, ye do number them by their hosts, thou and Aaron;

<sup>4</sup> and with you there is a man for a tribe, each is a head to the house of his fathers.

<sup>5</sup> 'And these [are] the names of the men who stand with you: 'For Reuben — Elizur son of Shedeur.

<sup>44</sup> These [are] those numbered, whom Moses numbered — Aaron also, and the princes of Israel, twelve men — each for the house of his fathers, they have been.

<sup>45</sup> And they are, all those numbered of the sons of Israel, by the house of their fathers, from a son of twenty years and upward, every one going out to the host in Israel,

<sup>46</sup> yea, all those numbered are six hundred thousand, and three thousand, and five hundred and fifty.

<sup>47</sup> And the Levites, for the tribe of their fathers, have not numbered themselves in their midst,

<sup>48</sup> seeing Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,

<sup>49</sup> 'Only, the tribe of Levi thou dost not number, and their sum thou dost not take up in the midst of the sons of Israel;

<sup>50</sup> and thou, appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all its vessels, and over all that it hath; they bear the tabernacle, and all its vessels, and they serve it; and round about the tabernacle they encamp.

<sup>51</sup> 'And in the journeying of the tabernacle, the Levites take it down, and in the encamping of the tabernacle, the Levites raise it up; and the stranger who is coming near is put to death.'

<sup>52</sup> And the sons of Israel have encamped, each by his camp, and each by his standard, by their hosts;

<sup>53</sup> and the Levites encamp round about the tabernacle of the testimony; and there is no wrath on the company of the sons of Israel, and the Levites have kept the charge of the tabernacle of the testimony.

<sup>54</sup> And the sons of Israel do according to all that Jehovah hath commanded Moses; so they have done.
