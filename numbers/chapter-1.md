**⁴⁶** yea, all those numbered are six hundred thousand, and three thousand, and five hundred and fifty.

**⁴⁷** And the Levites, for the tribe of their fathers, have not numbered themselves in their midst,

**⁴⁸** seeing Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,

**⁴⁹** 'Only, the tribe of Levi thou dost not number, and their sum thou dost not take up in the midst of the sons of Israel;

**⁵⁰** and thou, appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all its vessels, and over all that it hath; they bear the tabernacle, and all its vessels, and they serve it; and round about the tabernacle they encamp.

**⁵¹** 'And in the journeying of the tabernacle, the Levites take it down, and in the encamping of the tabernacle, the Levites raise it up; and the stranger who is coming near is put to death.'

**⁵²** And the sons of Israel have encamped, each by his camp, and each by his standard, by their hosts;

**⁵³** and the Levites encamp round about the tabernacle of the testimony; and there is no wrath on the company of the sons of Israel, and the Levites have kept the charge of the tabernacle of the testimony.

**⁵⁴** And the sons of Israel do according to all that Jehovah hath commanded Moses; so they have done.
