**⁵²** then ye have dispossessed all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and have destroyed all their imagery, yea, all their molten images ye destroy, and all their high places ye lay waste,

**⁵³** and ye have possessed the land, and dwelt in it, for to you I have given the land — to possess it.

**⁵⁴** 'And ye have inherited the land by lot, by your families; to the many ye increase their inheritance, and to the few ye diminish their inheritance; whither the lot goeth out to him, it is his; by the tribes of your fathers ye inherit.

**⁵⁵** 'And if ye do not dispossess the inhabitants of the land from before you, then it hath been, those whom ye let remain of them, [are] for pricks in your eyes, and for thorns in your sides, and they have distressed you on the land in which ye are dwelling,

**⁵⁶** and it hath come to pass, as I thought to do to them — I do to you.'
