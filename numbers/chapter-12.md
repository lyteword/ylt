# Numbers 12 

**¹** And Miriam speaketh — Aaron also — against Moses concerning the circumstance of the Cushite woman whom he had taken: for a Cushite woman he had taken;

**²** and they say, 'Only by Moses hath Jehovah spoken? also by us hath he not spoken?' and Jehovah heareth.

**³** And the man Moses [is] very humble, more than any of the men who [are] on the face of the ground.

**⁴** And Jehovah saith suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, 'Come out ye three unto the tent of meeting;' and they three come out.

**⁵** And Jehovah cometh down in the pillar of the cloud, and standeth at the opening of the tent, and calleth Aaron and Miriam, and they come out both of them.

**⁶** And He saith, 'Hear, I pray you, My words: If your prophet is of Jehovah — in an appearance unto him I make Myself known; in a dream I speak with him;

**⁷** not so My servant Moses; in all My house he [is] stedfast;

**⁸** mouth unto mouth I speak with him, and [by] an appearance, and not in riddles; and the form of Jehovah he beholdeth attentively; and wherefore have ye not been afraid to speak against My servant — against Moses?'

**⁹** And the anger of Jehovah burneth against them, and He goeth on,

**¹⁰** and the cloud hath turned aside from off the tent, and lo, Miriam [is] leprous as snow; and Aaron turneth unto Miriam, and lo, leprous!

**¹¹** And Aaron saith unto Moses, 'O, my lord, I pray thee, lay not upon us sin [in] which we have been foolish, and [in] which we have sinned;

**¹²** let her not, I pray thee, be as [one] dead, when in his coming out from the womb of his mother — the half of his flesh is consumed.'

**¹³** And Moses crieth unto Jehovah, saying, 'O God, I pray Thee, give, I pray Thee, healing to her.'

**¹⁴** And Jehovah saith unto Moses, 'And her father had but spat in her face — is she not ashamed seven days? she is shut out seven days at the outside of the camp, and afterwards she is gathered.'

**¹⁵** And Miriam is shut out at the outside of the camp seven days, and the people hath not journeyed till Miriam is gathered;

**¹⁶** and afterwards have the people journeyed from Hazeroth, and they encamp in the wilderness of Paran.
