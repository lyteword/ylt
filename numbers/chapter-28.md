# Chapter 28

<sup>1</sup> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,

<sup>2</sup> 'Command the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, My offering, My bread for My fire-offerings, My sweet fragrance, ye take heed to bring near to Me in its appointed season.

<sup>3</sup> 'And thou hast said to them, This [is] the fire-offering which ye bring near to Jehovah: two lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones, daily, a continual burnt-offering;

<sup>4</sup> the one lamb thou preparest in the morning, and the second lamb thou preparest between the evenings;

<sup>5</sup> and a tenth of the ephah of flour for a present, mixed with beaten oil, a fourth of the hin;

<sup>6</sup> a continual burnt-offering, which was made in mount Sinai, for sweet fragrance, a fire-offering to Jehovah;

<sup>7</sup> and its libation, a fourth of the hin for the one lamb; in the sanctuary cause thou a libation of strong drink to be poured out to Jehovah.

<sup>8</sup> 'And the second lamb thou dost prepare between the evenings; as the present of the morning, and as its libation thou preparest — a fire-offering, a sweet fragrance to Jehovah.

<sup>9</sup> 'And on the sabbath-day, two lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones, and two-tenth deals of flour, a present, mixed with oil, and its libation;

<sup>10</sup> the burnt-offering of the sabbath in its sabbath, besides the continual burnt-offering and its libation.

<sup>11</sup> 'And in the beginnings of your months ye bring near a burnt-offering to Jehovah: two bullocks, sons of the herd, and one ram, seven lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones;

<sup>12</sup> and three-tenth deals of flour, a present, mixed with oil, for the one bullock, and two-tenth deals of flour, a present, mixed with oil, for the one ram;

<sup>13</sup> and a several tenth deal of flour, a present, mixed with oil, for the one lamb; a burnt-offering, a sweet fragrance, a fire-offering to Jehovah;

<sup>14</sup> and their libations are a half of the hin to a bullock, and a third of the hin to a ram, and a fourth of the hin to a lamb, of wine; this [is] the burnt-offering of every month for the months of the year;

<sup>15</sup> and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering to Jehovah; besides the continual burnt-offering it is prepared, and its libation.

<sup>16</sup> 'And in the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, [is] the passover to Jehovah;

<sup>17</sup> and in the fifteenth day of this month [is] a festival, seven days unleavened food is eaten;

<sup>18</sup> in the first day [is] an holy convocation, ye do no servile work,

<sup>19</sup> and ye have brought near a fire-offering, a burnt-offering to Jehovah: two bullocks, sons of the herd, and one ram, and seven lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones they are for you;

<sup>20</sup> and their present, flour mixed with oil, three-tenth deals for a bullock, and two-tenth deals for a ram ye do prepare;

<sup>21</sup> a several tenth deal thou preparest for the one lamb, for the seven lambs,

<sup>22</sup> and one goat, a sin-offering, to make atonement for you.

<sup>23</sup> 'Apart from the burnt-offering of the morning, which [is] for the continual burnt-offering, ye prepare these;

<sup>24</sup> according to these ye prepare daily, seven days, bread of a fire-offering, a sweet fragrance, to Jehovah; besides the continual burnt-offering it is prepared, and its libation;

<sup>25</sup> and on the seventh day a holy convocation ye have, ye do no servile work.

<sup>26</sup> 'And in the day of the first-fruits, in your bringing near a new present to Jehovah, in your weeks, a holy convocation ye have; ye do no servile work;

<sup>27</sup> and ye have brought near a burnt-offering for sweet fragrance to Jehovah: two bullocks, sons of the herd, one ram, seven lambs, sons of a year,

<sup>28</sup> and their present, flour mixed with oil, three-tenth deals to the one bullock, two-tenth deals to the one ram,

<sup>29</sup> a several tenth deal to the one lamb, for the seven lambs;

<sup>30</sup> one kid of the goats to make atonement for you;

<sup>31</sup> apart from the continual burnt-offering and its present ye prepare [them] (perfect ones they are for you) and their libations.
