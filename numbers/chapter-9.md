# Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, in the wilderness of Sinai, in the second year of their going out of the land of Egypt, in the first month, saying,

<sup>2</sup> 'Also, the sons of Israel prepare the passover in its appointed season;

<sup>3</sup> in the fourteenth day of this month between the evenings ye prepare it in its appointed season; according to all its statutes, and according to all its ordinances ye prepare it.'

<sup>4</sup> And Moses speaketh unto the sons of Israel to prepare the passover,

<sup>5</sup> and they prepare the passover in the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month, between the evenings, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that Jehovah hath commanded Moses, so have the sons of Israel done.

<sup>6</sup> And there are men who have been defiled by the body of a man, and they have not been able to prepare the passover on that day, and they come near before Moses, and before Aaron, on that day,

<sup>7</sup> and those men say unto him, 'We are defiled by the body of a man; why are we withheld so as not to bring near the offering of Jehovah in its appointed season, in the midst of the sons of Israel?'

<sup>8</sup> And Moses saith unto them, 'Stand ye, and I hear what Jehovah hath commanded concerning you.'

<sup>9</sup> And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,

<sup>10</sup> 'Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, Though any man is unclean by a body or in a distant journey (of you or of your generations), yet he hath prepared a passover to Jehovah;

<sup>11</sup> in the second month, on the fourteenth day, between the evenings they prepare it; with unleavened and bitter things they eat it;

<sup>12</sup> they do not leave of till morning; and a bone they do not break in it: according to all the statute of the passover they prepare it.

<sup>13</sup> 'And the man who is clean, and hath not been on a journey, and hath ceased to prepare the passover, even that person hath been cut off from his people; because the offering of Jehovah he hath not brought near, in its appointed season, that man doth bear his sin.

<sup>14</sup> 'And when a sojourner sojourneth with you, then he hath prepared a passover to Jehovah, according to the statute of the passover, and according to its ordinance, so he doth; one statute is to you, even to a sojourner, and to a native of the land.'

<sup>15</sup> And in the day of the raising up of the tabernacle hath the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony; and in the evening there is on the tabernacle as an appearance of fire till morning;

<sup>16</sup> so it is continually; the cloud covereth it, also the appearance of fire by night.

<sup>17</sup> And according to the going up of the cloud from off the tent and afterwards do the sons of Israel journey; and in the place where the cloud doth tabernacle, there do the sons of Israel encamp;

<sup>18</sup> by the command of Jehovah the sons of Israel journey, and by the command of Jehovah they encamp; all the days that the cloud doth tabernacle over the tabernacle they encamp.

<sup>19</sup> And in the cloud prolonging itself over the tabernacle many days, then have the sons of Israel kept the charge of Jehovah, and journey not,

<sup>20</sup> and so when the cloud is a number of days over the tabernacle; by the command of Jehovah they encamp, and by the command of Jehovah they journey.

<sup>21</sup> And so when the cloud is from evening till morning, when the cloud hath gone up in the morning, then they have journeyed; whether by day or by night, when the cloud hath gone up, then they have journeyed.

<sup>22</sup> Whether two days, or a month, or days, in the cloud prolonging itself over the tabernacle, to tabernacle over it, the sons of Israel encamp, and journey not; and in its being lifted up they journey;

<sup>23</sup> by the command of Jehovah they encamp, and by the command of Jehovah they journey; the charge of Jehovah they have kept, by the command of Jehovah in the hand of Moses.
