# Chapter 7

**¹** And it cometh to pass on the day of Moses' finishing setting up the tabernacle, that he anointeth it, and sanctifieth it, and all its vessels, and the altar, and all its vessels, and he anointeth them, and sanctifieth them,

**²** and the princes of Israel (heads of the house of their fathers, they [are] princes of the tribes, they who are standing over those numbered) bring near,

**³** yea, they bring their offering before Jehovah, six waggons covered, and twelve oxen — a waggon for two of the princes, and an ox for one — and they bring them near before the tabernacle.

**⁴** And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,

**⁵** 'Receive from them, and they have been to do the service of the tent of meeting, and thou hast given them unto the Levites, each according to his service.'

**⁶** And Moses taketh the waggons and the oxen, and giveth them unto the Levites.

**⁷** The two of the waggons and the four of the oxen he hath given to the sons of Gershon, according to their service,

**⁸** and the four of the waggons and the eight of the oxen he hath given to the sons of Merari, according to their service, by the hand of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest;

**⁹** and to the sons of Kohath he hath not given, for the service of the sanctuary [is] on them: on the shoulder they bear.

**¹⁰** And the princes bring near the dedication of the altar in the day of its being anointed; yea, the princes bring near their offering before the altar.
