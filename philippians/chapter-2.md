# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> If, then, any exhortation [is] in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any bowels and mercies,

<sup>2</sup> fulfil ye my joy, that ye may mind the same thing — having the same love — of one soul — minding the one thing,

<sup>3</sup> nothing in rivalry or vain-glory, but in humility of mind one another counting more excellent than yourselves —

<sup>4</sup> each not to your own look ye, but each also to the things of others.

<sup>5</sup> For, let this mind be in you that [is] also in Christ Jesus,

<sup>6</sup> who, being in the form of God, thought [it] not robbery to be equal to God,

<sup>7</sup> but did empty himself, the form of a servant having taken, in the likeness of men having been made,

<sup>8</sup> and in fashion having been found as a man, he humbled himself, having become obedient unto death — death even of a cross,

<sup>9</sup> wherefore, also, God did highly exalt him, and gave to him a name that [is] above every name,

<sup>10</sup> that in the name of Jesus every knee may bow — of heavenlies, and earthlies, and what are under the earth —

<sup>11</sup> and every tongue may confess that Jesus Christ [is] Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

<sup>12</sup> So that, my beloved, as ye always obey, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, with fear and trembling your own salvation work out,

<sup>13</sup> for God it is who is working in you both to will and to work for His good pleasure.

<sup>14</sup> All things do without murmurings and reasonings,

<sup>15</sup> that ye may become blameless and harmless, children of God, unblemished in the midst of a generation crooked and perverse, among whom ye do appear as luminaries in the world,

<sup>16</sup> the word of life holding forth, for rejoicing to me in regard to a day of Christ, that not in vain did I run, nor in vain did I labour;

<sup>17</sup> but if also I am poured forth upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and joy with you all,

<sup>18</sup> because of this do ye also rejoice and joy with me.

<sup>19</sup> And I hope, in the Lord Jesus, Timotheus to send quickly to you, that I also may be of good spirit, having known the things concerning you,

<sup>20</sup> for I have no one like-minded, who sincerely for the things concerning you will care,

<sup>21</sup> for the whole seek their own things, not the things of the Christ Jesus,

<sup>22</sup> and the proof of him ye know, that as a child [serveth] a father, with me he did serve in regard to the good news;

<sup>23</sup> him, indeed, therefore, I hope to send, when I may see through the things concerning me — immediately;

<sup>24</sup> and I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall quickly come.

<sup>25</sup> And I thought [it] necessary Epaphroditus — my brother, and fellow-workman, and fellow-soldier, and your apostle and servant to my need — to send unto you,

<sup>26</sup> seeing he was longing after you all, and in heaviness, because ye heard that he ailed,

<sup>27</sup> for he also ailed nigh to death, but God did deal kindly with him, and not with him only, but also with me, that sorrow upon sorrow I might not have.

<sup>28</sup> The more eagerly, therefore, I did send him, that having seen him again ye may rejoice, and I may be the less sorrowful;

<sup>29</sup> receive him, therefore, in the Lord, with all joy, and hold such in honour,

<sup>30</sup> because on account of the work of the Christ he drew near to death, having hazarded the life that he might fill up your deficiency of service unto me.
