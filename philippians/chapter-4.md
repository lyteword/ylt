# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> So then, my brethren, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand ye in the Lord, beloved.

<sup>2</sup> Euodia I exhort, and Syntyche I exhort, to be of the same mind in the Lord;

<sup>3</sup> and I ask also thee, genuine yoke-fellow, be assisting those women who in the good news did strive along with me, with Clement also, and the others, my fellow-workers, whose names [are] in the book of life.

<sup>4</sup> Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice;

<sup>5</sup> let your forbearance be known to all men; the Lord [is] near;

<sup>6</sup> for nothing be anxious, but in everything by prayer, and by supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God;

<sup>7</sup> and the peace of God, that is surpassing all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.

<sup>8</sup> As to the rest, brethren, as many things as are true, as many as [are] grave, as many as [are] righteous, as many as [are] pure, as many as [are] lovely, as many as [are] of good report, if any worthiness, and if any praise, these things think upon;

<sup>9</sup> the things that also ye did learn, and receive, and hear, and saw in me, those do, and the God of the peace shall be with you.

<sup>10</sup> And I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at length ye flourished again in caring for me, for which also ye were caring, and lacked opportunity;

<sup>11</sup> not that in respect of want I say [it], for I did learn in the things in which I am — to be content;

<sup>12</sup> I have known both to be abased, and I have known to abound; in everything and in all things I have been initiated, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want.

<sup>13</sup> For all things I have strength, in Christ's strengthening me;

<sup>14</sup> but ye did well, having communicated with my tribulation;

<sup>15</sup> and ye have known, even ye Philippians, that in the beginning of the good news when I went forth from Macedonia, no assembly did communicate with me in regard to giving and receiving except ye only;

<sup>16</sup> because also in Thessalonica, both once and again to my need ye sent;

<sup>17</sup> not that I seek after the gift, but I seek after the fruit that is overflowing to your account;

<sup>18</sup> and I have all things, and abound; I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things from you — an odour of a sweet smell — a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God:

<sup>19</sup> and my God shall supply all your need, according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus;

<sup>20</sup> and to God, even our Father, [is] the glory — to the ages of the ages. Amen.

<sup>21</sup> Salute ye every saint in Christ Jesus; there salute you the brethren with me;

<sup>22</sup> there salute you all the saints, and specially those of Caesar's house;

<sup>23</sup> the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [is] with you all. Amen.
