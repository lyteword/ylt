# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Paul and Timotheus, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with overseers and ministrants;

<sup>2</sup> Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<sup>3</sup> I give thanks to my God upon all the remembrance of you,

<sup>4</sup> always, in every supplication of mine for you all, with joy making the supplication,

<sup>5</sup> for your contribution to the good news from the first day till now,

<sup>6</sup> having been confident of this very thing, that He who did begin in you a good work, will perform [it] till a day of Jesus Christ,

<sup>7</sup> according as it is righteous for me to think this in behalf of you all, because of my having you in the heart, both in my bonds, and [in] the defence and confirmation of the good news, all of you being fellow-partakers with me of grace.

<sup>8</sup> For God is my witness, how I long for you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ,

<sup>9</sup> and this I pray, that your love yet more and more may abound in full knowledge, and all judgment,

<sup>10</sup> for your proving the things that differ, that ye may be pure and offenceless — to a day of Christ,

<sup>11</sup> being filled with the fruit of righteousness, that [is] through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.

<sup>12</sup> And I wish you to know, brethren, that the things concerning me, rather to an advancement of the good news have come,

<sup>13</sup> so that my bonds have become manifest in Christ in the whole praetorium, and to the other places — all,

<sup>14</sup> and the greater part of the brethren in the Lord, having confidence by my bonds, are more abundantly bold — fearlessly to speak the word.

<sup>15</sup> Certain, indeed, even through envy and contention, and certain also through good-will, do preach the Christ;

<sup>16</sup> the one, indeed, of rivalry the Christ do proclaim, not purely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds,

<sup>17</sup> and the other out of love, having known that for defence of the good news I am set:

<sup>18</sup> what then? in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed — and in this I rejoice, yea, and shall rejoice.

<sup>19</sup> For I have known that this shall fall out to me for salvation, through your supplication, and the supply of the Spirit of Christ Jesus,

<sup>20</sup> according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, and in all freedom, as always, also now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death,

<sup>21</sup> for to me to live [is] Christ, and to die gain.

<sup>22</sup> And if to live in the flesh [is] to me a fruit of work, then what shall I choose? I know not;

<sup>23</sup> for I am pressed by the two, having the desire to depart, and to be with Christ, for it is far better,

<sup>24</sup> and to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account,

<sup>25</sup> and of this being persuaded, I have known that I shall remain and continue with you all, to your advancement and joy of the faith,

<sup>26</sup> that your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence again to you.

<sup>27</sup> Only worthily of the good news of the Christ conduct ye yourselves, that, whether having come and seen you, whether being absent I may hear of the things concerning you, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul, striving together for the faith of the good news,

<sup>28</sup> and not terrified in anything by those opposing, which to them indeed is a token of destruction, and to you of salvation, and that from God;

<sup>29</sup> because to you it was granted, on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also on behalf of him to suffer;

<sup>30</sup> the same conflict having, such as ye saw in me, and now hear of in me.
