# Chapter 15

<sup>1</sup> After these things hath the word of Jehovah been unto Abram in a vision, saying, 'Fear not, Abram, I [am] a shield to thee, thy reward [is] exceeding great.'

<sup>2</sup> And Abram saith, 'Lord Jehovah, what dost Thou give to me, and I am going childless? and an acquired son in my house is Demmesek Eliezer.'

<sup>3</sup> And Abram saith, 'Lo, to me Thou hast not given seed, and lo, a domestic doth heir me.'

<sup>4</sup> And lo, the word of Jehovah [is] unto him, saying, 'This [one] doth not heir thee; but he who cometh out from thy bowels, he doth heir thee;'

<sup>5</sup> and He bringeth him out without, and saith, 'Look attentively, I pray thee, towards the heavens, and count the stars, if thou art able to count them;' and He saith to him, 'Thus is thy seed.'

<sup>6</sup> And he hath believed in Jehovah, and He reckoneth it to him — righteousness.

<sup>7</sup> And He saith unto him, 'I [am] Jehovah who brought thee out from Ur of the Chaldees, to give to thee this land to possess it;'

<sup>8</sup> and he saith, 'Lord Jehovah, whereby do I know that I possess it?'

<sup>9</sup> And He saith unto him, 'Take for Me a heifer of three years, and a she-goat of three years, and a ram of three years, and a turtle-dove, and a young bird;'

<sup>10</sup> and he taketh to him all these, and separateth them in the midst, and putteth each piece over against its fellow, but the bird he hath not divided;

<sup>11</sup> and the ravenous birds come down upon the carcases, and Abram causeth them to turn back.

<sup>12</sup> And the sun is about to go in, and deep sleep hath fallen upon Abram, and lo, a terror of great darkness is falling upon him;

<sup>13</sup> and He saith to Abram, 'knowing — know that thy seed is a sojourner in a land not theirs, and they have served them, and they have afflicted them four hundred years,

<sup>14</sup> and the nation also whom they serve I judge, and after this they go out with great substance;

<sup>15</sup> and thou — thou comest in unto thy fathers in peace; thou art buried in a good old age;

<sup>16</sup> and the fourth generation doth turn back hither, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete.'

<sup>17</sup> And it cometh to pass — the sun hath gone in, and thick darkness hath been — and lo, a furnace of smoke, and a lamp of fire, which hath passed over between those pieces.

<sup>18</sup> In that day hath Jehovah made with Abram a covenant, saying, 'To thy seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Phrat,

<sup>19</sup> with the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite,

<sup>20</sup> and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim,

<sup>21</sup> and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.'
