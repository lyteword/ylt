# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> And these [are] births of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and born to them are sons after the deluge.

<sup>2</sup> 'Sons of Japheth [are] Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

<sup>3</sup> And sons of Gomer [are] Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.

<sup>4</sup> And sons of Javan [are] Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.

<sup>5</sup> By these have the isles of the nations been parted in their lands, each by his tongue, by their families, in their nations.

<sup>6</sup> And sons of Ham [are] Cush, and Mitzraim, and Phut, and Canaan.

<sup>7</sup> And sons of Cush [are] Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah; and sons of Raamah [are] Sheba and Dedan.

<sup>8</sup> And Cush hath begotten Nimrod;

<sup>9</sup> he hath begun to be a hero in the land; he hath been a hero in hunting before Jehovah; therefore it is said, 'As Nimrod the hero [in] hunting before Jehovah.'

<sup>10</sup> And the first part of his kingdom is Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar;

<sup>11</sup> from that land he hath gone out to Asshur, and buildeth Nineveh, even the broad places of the city, and Calah,

<sup>12</sup> and Resen, between Nineveh and Calah; it [is] the great city.

<sup>13</sup> And Mitzraim hath begotten the Ludim, and the Anamim, and the Lehabim, and the Naphtuhim,

<sup>14</sup> and the Pathrusim, and the Casluhim, (whence have come out Philistim,) and the Caphtorim.

<sup>15</sup> And Canaan hath begotten Sidon his first-born, and Heth,

<sup>16</sup> and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,

<sup>17</sup> and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,

<sup>18</sup> and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite; and afterwards have the families of the Canaanite been scattered.

<sup>19</sup> And the border of the Canaanite is from Sidon, [in] thy coming towards Gerar, unto Gaza; [in] thy coming towards Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, unto Lasha.

<sup>20</sup> These [are] sons of Ham, by their families, by their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.

<sup>21</sup> As to Shem, father of all sons of Eber, brother of Japheth the elder, he hath also begotten:

<sup>22</sup> Sons of Shem [are] Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.

<sup>23</sup> And sons of Aram [are] Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

<sup>24</sup> And Arphaxad hath begotten Salah, and Salah hath begotten Eber.

<sup>25</sup> And to Eber have two sons been born; the name of the one [is] Peleg (for in his days hath the earth been divided,) and his brother's name [is] Joktan.

<sup>26</sup> And Joktan hath begotten Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,

<sup>27</sup> and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,

<sup>28</sup> and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,

<sup>29</sup> and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab; all these [are] sons of Joktan;

<sup>30</sup> and their dwelling is from Mesha, [in] thy coming towards Sephar, a mount of the east.

<sup>31</sup> These [are] sons of Shem, by their families, by their tongues, in their lands, by their nations.

<sup>32</sup> These [are] families of the sons of Noah, by their births, in their nations, and by these have the nations been parted in the earth after the deluge.
