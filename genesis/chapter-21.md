# Genesis 21 

**¹** And Jehovah hath looked after Sarah as He hath said, and Jehovah doth to Sarah as He hath spoken;

**²** and Sarah conceiveth, and beareth a son to Abraham, to his old age, at the appointed time that God hath spoken of with him;

**³** and Abraham calleth the name of his son who is born to him, whom Sarah hath born to him — Isaac;

**⁴** and Abraham circumciseth Isaac his son, [being] a son of eight days, as God hath commanded him.

**⁵** And Abraham [is] a son of a hundred years in Isaac his son being born to him,

**⁶** and Sarah saith, 'God hath made laughter for me; every one who is hearing laugheth for me.'

**⁷** She saith also, 'Who hath said to Abraham, Sarah hath suckled sons, that I have born a son for his old age?'

**⁸** And the lad groweth, and is weaned, and Abraham maketh a great banquet in the day of Isaac's being weaned;

**⁹** and Sarah seeth the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she hath borne to Abraham, mocking,

**¹⁰** and she saith to Abraham, 'Cast out this handmaid and her son; for the son of this handmaid hath no possession with my son — with Isaac.'

**¹¹** And the thing is very wrong in the eyes of Abraham, for his son's sake;

**¹²** and God saith unto Abraham, 'Let it not be wrong in thine eyes because of the youth, and because of thy handmaid: all that Sarah saith unto thee — hearken to her voice, for in Isaac is a seed called to thee.

**¹³** As to the son of the handmaid also, for a nation I set him, because he [is] thy seed.'

**¹⁴** And Abraham riseth early in the morning, and taketh bread, and a bottle of water, and giveth unto Hagar (placing [it] on her shoulder), also the lad, and sendeth her out; and she goeth on, and goeth astray in the wilderness of Beer-Sheba;

**¹⁵** and the water is consumed from the bottle, and she placeth the lad under one of the shrubs.

**¹⁶** And she goeth and sitteth by herself over-against, afar off, about a bow-shot, for she said, 'Let me not look on the death of the lad;' and she sitteth over-against, and lifteth up her voice, and weepeth.

**¹⁷** And God heareth the voice of the youth; and the messenger of God calleth unto Hagar from the heavens, and saith to her, 'What to thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath hearkened unto the voice of the youth where he [is];

**¹⁸** rise, lift up the youth, and lay hold on him with thy hand, for for a great nation I set him.'

**¹⁹** And God openeth her eyes, and she seeth a well of water, and she goeth and filleth the bottle [with] water, and causeth the youth to drink;

**²⁰** and God is with the youth, and he groweth, and dwelleth in the wilderness, and is an archer;

**²¹** and he dwelleth in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother taketh for him a wife from the land of Egypt.

**²²** And it cometh to pass at that time that Abimelech speaketh — Phichol also, head of his host — unto Abraham, saying, 'God [is] with thee in all that thou art doing;

**²³** and now, swear to me by God here: thou dost not lie to me, or to my continuator, or to my successor; according to the kindness which I have done with thee thou dost with me, and with the land in which thou hast sojourned.'

**²⁴** And Abraham saith, 'I — I do swear.'

**²⁵** And Abraham reasoned with Abimelech concerning the matter of a well of water which Abimelech's servants have taken violently away,

**²⁶** and Abimelech saith, 'I have not known who hath done this thing, and even thou didst not declare to me, and I also, I have not heard save to-day.'

**²⁷** And Abraham taketh sheep and oxen, and giveth to Abimelech, and they make, both of them, a covenant;

**²⁸** and Abraham setteth seven Lambs of the flock by themselves.

**²⁹** And Abimelech saith unto Abraham, 'What [are] they — these seven lambs which thou hast set by themselves?'

**³⁰** And he saith, 'For — the seven lambs thou dost accept from my hand, so that it becometh a witness for me that I have digged this well;'

**³¹** therefore hath he called that place 'Beer-Sheba,' for there have both of them sworn.

**³²** And they make a covenant in Beer-Sheba, and Abimelech riseth — Phichol also, head of his host — and they turn back unto the land of the Philistines;

**³³** and [Abraham] planteth a tamarisk in Beer-Sheba, and preacheth there in the name of Jehovah, God age-during;

**³⁴** and Abraham sojourneth in the land of the Philistines many days.
