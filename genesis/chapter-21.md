# Chapter 21

<sup>1</sup> And Jehovah hath looked after Sarah as He hath said, and Jehovah doth to Sarah as He hath spoken;

<sup>2</sup> and Sarah conceiveth, and beareth a son to Abraham, to his old age, at the appointed time that God hath spoken of with him;

<sup>3</sup> and Abraham calleth the name of his son who is born to him, whom Sarah hath born to him — Isaac;

<sup>4</sup> and Abraham circumciseth Isaac his son, [being] a son of eight days, as God hath commanded him.

<sup>5</sup> And Abraham [is] a son of a hundred years in Isaac his son being born to him,

<sup>6</sup> and Sarah saith, 'God hath made laughter for me; every one who is hearing laugheth for me.'

<sup>7</sup> She saith also, 'Who hath said to Abraham, Sarah hath suckled sons, that I have born a son for his old age?'

<sup>8</sup> And the lad groweth, and is weaned, and Abraham maketh a great banquet in the day of Isaac's being weaned;

<sup>9</sup> and Sarah seeth the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she hath borne to Abraham, mocking,

<sup>10</sup> and she saith to Abraham, 'Cast out this handmaid and her son; for the son of this handmaid hath no possession with my son — with Isaac.'

<sup>11</sup> And the thing is very wrong in the eyes of Abraham, for his son's sake;

<sup>12</sup> and God saith unto Abraham, 'Let it not be wrong in thine eyes because of the youth, and because of thy handmaid: all that Sarah saith unto thee — hearken to her voice, for in Isaac is a seed called to thee.

<sup>13</sup> As to the son of the handmaid also, for a nation I set him, because he [is] thy seed.'

<sup>14</sup> And Abraham riseth early in the morning, and taketh bread, and a bottle of water, and giveth unto Hagar (placing [it] on her shoulder), also the lad, and sendeth her out; and she goeth on, and goeth astray in the wilderness of Beer-Sheba;

<sup>15</sup> and the water is consumed from the bottle, and she placeth the lad under one of the shrubs.

<sup>16</sup> And she goeth and sitteth by herself over-against, afar off, about a bow-shot, for she said, 'Let me not look on the death of the lad;' and she sitteth over-against, and lifteth up her voice, and weepeth.

<sup>17</sup> And God heareth the voice of the youth; and the messenger of God calleth unto Hagar from the heavens, and saith to her, 'What to thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath hearkened unto the voice of the youth where he [is];

<sup>18</sup> rise, lift up the youth, and lay hold on him with thy hand, for for a great nation I set him.'

<sup>19</sup> And God openeth her eyes, and she seeth a well of water, and she goeth and filleth the bottle [with] water, and causeth the youth to drink;

<sup>20</sup> and God is with the youth, and he groweth, and dwelleth in the wilderness, and is an archer;

<sup>21</sup> and he dwelleth in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother taketh for him a wife from the land of Egypt.

<sup>22</sup> And it cometh to pass at that time that Abimelech speaketh — Phichol also, head of his host — unto Abraham, saying, 'God [is] with thee in all that thou art doing;

<sup>23</sup> and now, swear to me by God here: thou dost not lie to me, or to my continuator, or to my successor; according to the kindness which I have done with thee thou dost with me, and with the land in which thou hast sojourned.'

<sup>24</sup> And Abraham saith, 'I — I do swear.'

<sup>25</sup> And Abraham reasoned with Abimelech concerning the matter of a well of water which Abimelech's servants have taken violently away,

<sup>26</sup> and Abimelech saith, 'I have not known who hath done this thing, and even thou didst not declare to me, and I also, I have not heard save to-day.'

<sup>27</sup> And Abraham taketh sheep and oxen, and giveth to Abimelech, and they make, both of them, a covenant;

<sup>28</sup> and Abraham setteth seven Lambs of the flock by themselves.

<sup>29</sup> And Abimelech saith unto Abraham, 'What [are] they — these seven lambs which thou hast set by themselves?'

<sup>30</sup> And he saith, 'For — the seven lambs thou dost accept from my hand, so that it becometh a witness for me that I have digged this well;'

<sup>31</sup> therefore hath he called that place 'Beer-Sheba,' for there have both of them sworn.

<sup>32</sup> And they make a covenant in Beer-Sheba, and Abimelech riseth — Phichol also, head of his host — and they turn back unto the land of the Philistines;

<sup>33</sup> and [Abraham] planteth a tamarisk in Beer-Sheba, and preacheth there in the name of Jehovah, God age-during;

<sup>34</sup> and Abraham sojourneth in the land of the Philistines many days.
