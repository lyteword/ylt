# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> And the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceiveth and beareth Cain, and saith, 'I have gotten a man by Jehovah;'

<sup>2</sup> and she addeth to bear his brother, even Abel. And Abel is feeding a flock, and Cain hath been servant of the ground.

<sup>3</sup> And it cometh to pass at the end of days that Cain bringeth from the fruit of the ground a present to Jehovah;

<sup>4</sup> and Abel, he hath brought, he also, from the female firstlings of his flock, even from their fat ones; and Jehovah looketh unto Abel and unto his present,

<sup>5</sup> and unto Cain and unto his present He hath not looked; and it is very displeasing to Cain, and his countenance is fallen.

<sup>6</sup> And Jehovah saith unto Cain, 'Why hast thou displeasure? and why hath thy countenance fallen?

<sup>7</sup> Is there not, if thou dost well, acceptance? and if thou dost not well, at the opening a sin-offering is crouching, and unto thee its desire, and thou rulest over it.'

<sup>8</sup> And Cain saith unto Abel his brother, ['Let us go into the field;'] and it cometh to pass in their being in the field, that Cain riseth up against Abel his brother, and slayeth him.

<sup>9</sup> And Jehovah saith unto Cain, 'Where [is] Abel thy brother?' and he saith, 'I have not known; my brother's keeper — I?'

<sup>10</sup> And He saith, 'What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood is crying unto Me from the ground;

<sup>11</sup> and now, cursed [art] thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth to receive the blood of thy brother from thy hand;

<sup>12</sup> when thou tillest the ground, it doth not add to give its strength to thee — a wanderer, even a trembling one, thou art in the earth.'

<sup>13</sup> And Cain saith unto Jehovah, 'Greater is my punishment than to be borne;

<sup>14</sup> lo, Thou hast driven me to-day from off the face of the ground, and from Thy face I am hid; and I have been a wanderer, even a trembling one, in the earth, and it hath been — every one finding me doth slay me.'

<sup>15</sup> And Jehovah saith to him, 'Therefore — of any slayer of Cain sevenfold it is required;' and Jehovah setteth to Cain a token that none finding him doth slay him.

<sup>16</sup> And Cain goeth out from before Jehovah, and dwelleth in the land, moving about east of Eden;

<sup>17</sup> and Cain knoweth his wife, and she conceiveth, and beareth Enoch; and he is building a city, and he calleth the name of the city, according to the name of his son — Enoch.

<sup>18</sup> And born to Enoch is Irad; and Irad hath begotten Mehujael; and Mehujael hath begotten Methusael; and Methusael hath begotten Lamech.

<sup>19</sup> And Lamech taketh to himself two wives, the name of the one Adah, and the name of the second Zillah.

<sup>20</sup> And Adah beareth Jabal, he hath been father of those inhabiting tents and purchased possessions;

<sup>21</sup> and the name of his brother [is] Jubal, he hath been father of every one handling harp and organ.

<sup>22</sup> And Zillah she also bare Tubal-Cain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron; and a sister of Tubal-Cain [is] Naamah.

<sup>23</sup> And Lamech saith to his wives: — 'Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Wives of Lamech, give ear [to] my saying: For a man I have slain for my wound, Even a young man for my hurt;

<sup>24</sup> For sevenfold is required for Cain, And for Lamech seventy and sevenfold.'

<sup>25</sup> And Adam again knoweth his wife, and she beareth a son, and calleth his name Seth, 'for God hath appointed for me another seed instead of Abel:' for Cain had slain him.

<sup>26</sup> And to Seth, to him also a son hath been born, and he calleth his name Enos; then a beginning was made of preaching in the name of Jehovah.
