# Chapter 11

**¹** And the whole earth is of one pronunciation, and of the same words,

**²** and it cometh to pass, in their journeying from the east, that they find a valley in the land of Shinar, and dwell there;

**³** and they say each one to his neighbour, 'Give help, let us make bricks, and burn [them] thoroughly:' and the brick is to them for stone, and the bitumen hath been to them for mortar.

**⁴** And they say, 'Give help, let us build for ourselves a city and tower, and its head in the heavens, and make for ourselves a name, lest we be scattered over the face of all the earth.'

**⁵** And Jehovah cometh down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men have builded;

**⁶** and Jehovah saith, 'Lo, the people [is] one, and one pronunciation [is] to them all, and this it hath dreamed of doing; and now, nothing is restrained from them of that which they have purposed to do.

**⁷** Give help, let us go down, and mingle there their pronunciation, so that a man doth not understand the pronunciation of his companion.'

**⁸** And Jehovah doth scatter them from thence over the face of all the earth, and they cease to build the city;

**⁹** therefore hath [one] called its name Babel, for there hath Jehovah mingled the pronunciation of all the earth, and from thence hath Jehovah scattered them over the face of all the earth.

**¹⁰** These [are] births of Shem: Shem [is] a son of an hundred years, and begetteth Arphaxad two years after the deluge.

**¹¹** And Shem liveth after his begetting Arphaxad five hundred years, and begetteth sons and daughters.

**¹²** And Arphaxad hath lived five and thirty years, and begetteth Salah.

**¹³** And Arphaxad liveth after his begetting Salah four hundred and three years, and begetteth sons and daughters.

**¹⁴** And Salah hath lived thirty years, and begetteth Eber.

**¹⁵** And Salah liveth after his begetting Eber four hundred and three years, and begetteth sons and daughters.

**¹⁶** And Eber liveth four and thirty years, and begetteth Peleg.

**¹⁷** And Eber liveth after his begetting Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begetteth sons and daughters.

**¹⁸** And Peleg liveth thirty years, and begetteth Reu.

**¹⁹** And Peleg liveth after his begetting Reu two hundred and nine years, and begetteth sons and daughters.

**²⁰** And Reu liveth two and thirty years, and begetteth Serug.

**²¹** And Reu liveth after his begetting Serug two hundred and seven years, and begetteth sons and daughters.

**²²** And Serug liveth thirty years, and begetteth Nahor.

**²³** And Serug liveth after his begetting Nahor two hundred years, and begetteth sons and daughters.

**²⁴** And Nahor liveth nine and twenty years, and begetteth Terah.

**²⁵** And Nahor liveth after his begetting Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begetteth sons and daughters.

**²⁶** And Terah liveth seventy years, and begetteth Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

**²⁷** And these [are] births of Terah: Terah hath begotten Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran hath begotten Lot;

**²⁸** and Haran dieth in the presence of Terah his father, in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees.

**²⁹** And Abram and Nahor take to themselves wives; the name of Abram's wife [is] Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife [is] Milcah, daughter of Haran, father of Milcah, and father of Iscah.

**³⁰** And Sarai is barren — she hath no child.

**³¹** And Terah taketh Abram his son, and Lot, son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, wife of Abram his son, and they go out with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go towards the land of Canaan; and they come unto Charan, and dwell there.

**³²** And the days of Terah are two hundred and five years, and Terah dieth in Charan.
