# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> And the whole earth is of one pronunciation, and of the same words,

<sup>2</sup> and it cometh to pass, in their journeying from the east, that they find a valley in the land of Shinar, and dwell there;

<sup>3</sup> and they say each one to his neighbour, 'Give help, let us make bricks, and burn [them] thoroughly:' and the brick is to them for stone, and the bitumen hath been to them for mortar.

<sup>4</sup> And they say, 'Give help, let us build for ourselves a city and tower, and its head in the heavens, and make for ourselves a name, lest we be scattered over the face of all the earth.'

<sup>5</sup> And Jehovah cometh down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men have builded;

<sup>6</sup> and Jehovah saith, 'Lo, the people [is] one, and one pronunciation [is] to them all, and this it hath dreamed of doing; and now, nothing is restrained from them of that which they have purposed to do.

<sup>7</sup> Give help, let us go down, and mingle there their pronunciation, so that a man doth not understand the pronunciation of his companion.'

<sup>8</sup> And Jehovah doth scatter them from thence over the face of all the earth, and they cease to build the city;

<sup>9</sup> therefore hath [one] called its name Babel, for there hath Jehovah mingled the pronunciation of all the earth, and from thence hath Jehovah scattered them over the face of all the earth.

<sup>10</sup> These [are] births of Shem: Shem [is] a son of an hundred years, and begetteth Arphaxad two years after the deluge.

<sup>11</sup> And Shem liveth after his begetting Arphaxad five hundred years, and begetteth sons and daughters.

<sup>12</sup> And Arphaxad hath lived five and thirty years, and begetteth Salah.

<sup>13</sup> And Arphaxad liveth after his begetting Salah four hundred and three years, and begetteth sons and daughters.

<sup>14</sup> And Salah hath lived thirty years, and begetteth Eber.

<sup>15</sup> And Salah liveth after his begetting Eber four hundred and three years, and begetteth sons and daughters.

<sup>16</sup> And Eber liveth four and thirty years, and begetteth Peleg.

<sup>17</sup> And Eber liveth after his begetting Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begetteth sons and daughters.

<sup>18</sup> And Peleg liveth thirty years, and begetteth Reu.

<sup>19</sup> And Peleg liveth after his begetting Reu two hundred and nine years, and begetteth sons and daughters.

<sup>20</sup> And Reu liveth two and thirty years, and begetteth Serug.

<sup>21</sup> And Reu liveth after his begetting Serug two hundred and seven years, and begetteth sons and daughters.

<sup>22</sup> And Serug liveth thirty years, and begetteth Nahor.

<sup>23</sup> And Serug liveth after his begetting Nahor two hundred years, and begetteth sons and daughters.

<sup>25</sup> And Nahor liveth after his begetting Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begetteth sons and daughters.

<sup>26</sup> And Terah liveth seventy years, and begetteth Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

<sup>27</sup> And these [are] births of Terah: Terah hath begotten Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran hath begotten Lot;

<sup>28</sup> and Haran dieth in the presence of Terah his father, in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees.

<sup>29</sup> And Abram and Nahor take to themselves wives; the name of Abram's wife [is] Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife [is] Milcah, daughter of Haran, father of Milcah, and father of Iscah.

<sup>30</sup> And Sarai is barren — she hath no child.

<sup>31</sup> And Terah taketh Abram his son, and Lot, son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, wife of Abram his son, and they go out with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go towards the land of Canaan; and they come unto Charan, and dwell there.

<sup>32</sup> And the days of Terah are two hundred and five years, and Terah dieth in Charan.
