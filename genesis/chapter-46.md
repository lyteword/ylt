# Chapter 46

<sup>1</sup> And Israel journeyeth, and all that he hath, and cometh in to Beer-Sheba, and sacrificeth sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac;

<sup>2</sup> and God speaketh to Israel in visions of the night, and saith, 'Jacob, Jacob;' and he saith, 'Here [am] I.'

<sup>3</sup> And He saith, 'I [am] God, God of thy father, be not afraid of going down to Egypt, for for a great nation I set thee there;

<sup>4</sup> I — I go down with thee to Egypt, and I — I also certainly bring thee up, and Joseph doth put his hand on thine eyes.'

<sup>29</sup> and Joseph harnesseth his chariot, and goeth up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and appeareth unto him, and falleth on his neck, and weepeth on his neck again;

<sup>30</sup> and Israel saith unto Joseph, 'Let me die this time, after my seeing thy face, for thou [art] yet alive.'

<sup>31</sup> And Joseph saith unto his brethren, and unto the house of his father, 'I go up, and declare to Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and the house of my father who [are] in the land of Canaan have come in unto me;

<sup>32</sup> and the men [are] feeders of a flock, for they have been men of cattle; and their flock, and their herd, and all that they have, they have brought.'

<sup>33</sup> 'And it hath come to pass when Pharaoh calleth for you, and hath said, What [are] your works?

<sup>34</sup> that ye have said, Thy servants have been men of cattle from our youth, even until now, both we and our fathers, — in order that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen, for the abomination of the Egyptians is every one feeding a flock.'
