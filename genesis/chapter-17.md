# Chapter 17

<sup>1</sup> And Abram is a son of ninety and nine years, and Jehovah appeareth unto Abram, and saith unto him, 'I [am] God Almighty, walk habitually before Me, and be thou perfect;

<sup>2</sup> and I give My covenant between Me and thee, and multiply thee very exceedingly.'

<sup>3</sup> And Abram falleth upon his face, and God speaketh with him, saying,

<sup>4</sup> 'I — lo, My covenant [is] with thee, and thou hast become father of a multitude of nations;

<sup>5</sup> and thy name is no more called Abram, but thy name hath been Abraham, for father of a multitude of nations have I made thee;

<sup>6</sup> and I have made thee exceeding fruitful, and made thee become nations, and kings go out from thee.

<sup>7</sup> 'And I have established My covenant between Me and thee, and thy seed after thee, to their generations, for a covenant age-during, to become God to thee, and to thy seed after thee;

<sup>8</sup> and I have given to thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy sojournings, the whole land of Canaan, for a possession age-during, and I have become their God.'

<sup>9</sup> And God saith unto Abraham, 'And thou dost keep My covenant, thou and thy seed after thee, to their generations;

<sup>10</sup> this [is] My covenant which ye keep between Me and you, and thy seed after thee: Every male of you [is] to be circumcised;

<sup>11</sup> and ye have circumcised the flesh of your foreskin, and it hath become a token of a covenant between Me and you.

<sup>12</sup> 'And a son of eight days is circumcised by you; every male to your generations, born in the house, or bought with money from any son of a stranger, who is not of thy seed;

<sup>13</sup> he is certainly circumcised who [is] born in thine house, or bought with thy money; and My covenant hath become in your flesh a covenant age-during;

<sup>14</sup> and an uncircumcised one, a male, the flesh of whose foreskin is not circumcised, even that person hath been cut off from his people; My covenant he hath broken.'

<sup>15</sup> And God saith unto Abraham, 'Sarai thy wife — thou dost not call her name Sarai, for Sarah [is] her name;

<sup>16</sup> and I have blessed her, and have also given to thee a son from her; and I have blessed her, and she hath become nations — kings of peoples are from her.'

<sup>17</sup> And Abraham falleth upon his face, and laugheth, and saith in his heart, 'To the son of an hundred years is one born? or doth Sarah — daughter of ninety years — bear?'

<sup>18</sup> And Abraham saith unto God, 'O that Ishmael may live before Thee;'

<sup>19</sup> and God saith, 'Sarah thy wife is certainly bearing a son to thee, and thou hast called his name Isaac, and I have established My covenant with him, for a covenant age-during, to his seed after him.

<sup>20</sup> As to Ishmael, I have heard thee; lo, I have blessed him, and made him fruitful, and multiplied him, very exceedingly; twelve princes doth he beget, and I have made him become a great nation;

<sup>21</sup> and My covenant I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah doth bear to thee at this appointed time in the next year;'

<sup>22</sup> and He finisheth speaking with him, and God goeth up from Abraham.

<sup>23</sup> And Abraham taketh Ishmael his son, and all those born in his house, and all those bought with his money — every male among the men of Abraham's house — and circumciseth the flesh of their foreskin, in this self-same day, as God hath spoken with him.

<sup>24</sup> And Abraham [is] a son of ninety and nine years in the flesh of his foreskin being circumcised;

<sup>25</sup> and Ishmael his son [is] a son of thirteen years in the flesh of his foreskin being circumcised;

<sup>26</sup> in this self-same day hath Abraham been circumcised, and Ishmael his son;

<sup>27</sup> and all the men of his house — born in the house, and bought with money from the son of a stranger — have been circumcised with him.
