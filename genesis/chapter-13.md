# Chapter 13

<sup>1</sup> And Abram goeth up from Egypt (he and his wife, and all that he hath, and Lot with him) towards the south;

<sup>2</sup> and Abram [is] exceedingly wealthy in cattle, in silver, and in gold.

<sup>3</sup> And he goeth on his journeyings from the south, even unto Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the commencement, between Bethel and Hai —

<sup>4</sup> unto the place of the altar which he made there at the first, and there doth Abram preach in the name of Jehovah.

<sup>5</sup> And also to Lot, who is going with Abram, there hath been sheep and oxen and tents;

<sup>6</sup> and the land hath not suffered them to dwell together, for their substance hath been much, and they have not been able to dwell together;

<sup>7</sup> and there is a strife between those feeding Abram's cattle and those feeding Lot's cattle; and the Canaanite and the Perizzite [are] then dwelling in the land.

<sup>8</sup> And Abram saith unto Lot, 'Let there not, I pray thee, be strife between me and thee, and between my shepherds and thy shepherds, for we [are] men — brethren.

<sup>9</sup> Is not all the land before thee? be parted, I pray thee, from me; if to the left, then I to the right; and if to the right, then I to the left.'

<sup>10</sup> And Lot lifteth up his eyes, and seeth the whole circuit of the Jordan that it [is] all a watered country (before Jehovah's destroying Sodom and Gomorrah, as Jehovah's garden, as the land of Egypt,) in thy coming toward Zoar,

<sup>11</sup> and Lot chooseth for himself the whole circuit of the Jordan; and Lot journeyeth from the east, and they are parted — a man from his companion;

<sup>12</sup> Abram hath dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot hath dwelt in the cities of the circuit, and tenteth unto Sodom;

<sup>13</sup> and the men of Sodom [are] evil, and sinners before Jehovah exceedingly.

<sup>14</sup> And Jehovah said unto Abram, after Lot's being parted from him, 'Lift up, I pray thee, thine eyes, and look from the place where thou [art], northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward;

<sup>15</sup> for the whole of the land which thou are seeing, to thee I give it, and to thy seed — to the age.

<sup>16</sup> And I have set thy seed as dust of the earth, so that, if one is able to number the dust of the earth, even thy seed is numbered;

<sup>17</sup> rise, go up and down through the land, to its length, and to its breadth, for to thee I give it.'

<sup>18</sup> And Abram tenteth, and cometh, and dwelleth among the oaks of Mamre, which [are] in Hebron, and buildeth there an altar to Jehovah.
