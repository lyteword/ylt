# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> And it cometh to pass that mankind have begun to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters have been born to them,

<sup>2</sup> and sons of God see the daughters of men that they [are] fair, and they take to themselves women of all whom they have chosen.

<sup>3</sup> And Jehovah saith, 'My Spirit doth not strive in man — to the age; in their erring they [are] flesh:' and his days have been an hundred and twenty years.

<sup>4</sup> The fallen ones were in the earth in those days, and even afterwards when sons of God come in unto daughters of men, and they have borne to them — they [are] the heroes, who, from of old, [are] the men of name.

<sup>5</sup> And Jehovah seeth that abundant [is] the wickedness of man in the earth, and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart only evil all the day;

<sup>6</sup> and Jehovah repenteth that He hath made man in the earth, and He grieveth Himself — unto His heart.

<sup>7</sup> And Jehovah saith, 'I wipe away man whom I have prepared from off the face of the ground, from man unto beast, unto creeping thing, and unto fowl of the heavens, for I have repented that I have made them.'

<sup>8</sup> And Noah found grace in the eyes of Jehovah.

<sup>9</sup> These [are] births of Noah: Noah [is] a righteous man; perfect he hath been among his generations; with God hath Noah walked habitually.

<sup>10</sup> And Noah begetteth three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

<sup>11</sup> And the earth is corrupt before God, and the earth is filled [with] violence.

<sup>12</sup> And God seeth the earth, and lo, it hath been corrupted, for all flesh hath corrupted its way on the earth.

<sup>13</sup> And God said to Noah, 'An end of all flesh hath come before Me, for the earth hath been full of violence from their presence; and lo, I am destroying them with the earth.

<sup>14</sup> 'Make for thyself an ark of gopher-wood; rooms dost thou make with the ark, and thou hast covered it within and without with cypress;

<sup>15</sup> and this [is] that which thou dost with it: three hundred cubits [is] the length of the ark, fifty cubits its breadth, and thirty cubits its height;

<sup>16</sup> a window dost thou make for the ark, and unto a cubit thou dost restrain it from above; and the opening of the ark thou dost put in its side, — lower, second, and third [stories] dost thou make it.

<sup>17</sup> 'And I, lo, I am bringing in the deluge of waters on the earth to destroy all flesh, in which [is] a living spirit, from under the heavens; all that [is] in the earth doth expire.

<sup>18</sup> 'And I have established My covenant with thee, and thou hast come in unto the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy son's wives with thee;

<sup>19</sup> and of all that liveth, of all flesh, two of every [sort] thou dost bring in unto the ark, to keep alive with thee; male and female are they.

<sup>20</sup> Of the fowl after its kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every [sort] they come in unto thee, to keep alive.

<sup>21</sup> 'And thou, take to thyself of all food that is eaten; and thou hast gathered unto thyself, and it hath been to thee and to them for food.'

<sup>22</sup> And Noah doth according to all that God hath commanded him; so hath he done.
