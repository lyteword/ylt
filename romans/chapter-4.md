# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> What, then, shall we say Abraham our father, to have found, according to flesh?

<sup>2</sup> for if Abraham by works was declared righteous, he hath to boast — but not before God;

<sup>3</sup> for what doth the writing say? 'And Abraham did believe God, and it was reckoned to him — to righteousness;'

<sup>4</sup> and to him who is working, the reward is not reckoned of grace, but of debt;

<sup>5</sup> and to him who is not working, and is believing upon Him who is declaring righteous the impious, his faith is reckoned — to righteousness:

<sup>6</sup> even as David also doth speak of the happiness of the man to whom God doth reckon righteousness apart from works:

<sup>7</sup> 'Happy they whose lawless acts were forgiven, and whose sins were covered;

<sup>8</sup> happy the man to whom the Lord may not reckon sin.'

<sup>9</sup> [Is] this happiness, then, upon the circumcision, or also upon the uncircumcision — for we say that the faith was reckoned to Abraham — to righteousness?

<sup>10</sup> how then was it reckoned? he being in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision;

<sup>11</sup> and a sign he did receive of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith in the uncircumcision, for his being father of all those believing through uncircumcision, for the righteousness also being reckoned to them,

<sup>12</sup> and father of circumcision to those not of circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of the faith, that [is] in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham.

<sup>13</sup> For not through law [is] the promise to Abraham, or to his seed, of his being heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith;

<sup>14</sup> for if they who are of law [are] heirs, the faith hath been made void, and the promise hath been made useless;

<sup>15</sup> for the law doth work wrath; for where law is not, neither [is] transgression.

<sup>16</sup> Because of this [it is] of faith, that [it may be] according to grace, for the promise being sure to all the seed, not to that which [is] of the law only, but also to that which [is] of the faith of Abraham,

<sup>17</sup> who is father of us all (according as it hath been written — 'A father of many nations I have set thee,') before Him whom he did believe — God, who is quickening the dead, and is calling the things that be not as being.

<sup>18</sup> Who, against hope in hope did believe, for his becoming father of many nations according to that spoken: 'So shall thy seed be;'

<sup>19</sup> and not having been weak in the faith, he did not consider his own body, already become dead, (being about a hundred years old,) and the deadness of Sarah's womb,

<sup>20</sup> and at the promise of God did not stagger in unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, having given glory to God,

<sup>21</sup> and having been fully persuaded that what He hath promised He is able also to do:

<sup>22</sup> wherefore also it was reckoned to him to righteousness.

<sup>23</sup> And it was not written on his account alone, that it was reckoned to him,

<sup>24</sup> but also on ours, to whom it is about to be reckoned — to us believing on Him who did raise up Jesus our Lord out of the dead,

<sup>25</sup> who was delivered up because of our offences, and was raised up because of our being declared righteous.
