# Chapter 14

<sup>1</sup> And him who is weak in the faith receive ye — not to determinations of reasonings;

<sup>2</sup> one doth believe that he may eat all things — and he who is weak doth eat herbs;

<sup>3</sup> let not him who is eating despise him who is not eating: and let not him who is not eating judge him who is eating, for God did receive him.

<sup>4</sup> Thou — who art thou that art judging another's domestic? to his own master he doth stand or fall; and he shall be made to stand, for God is able to make him stand.

<sup>5</sup> One doth judge one day above another, and another doth judge every day [alike]; let each in his own mind be fully assured.

<sup>6</sup> He who is regarding the day, to the Lord he doth regard [it], and he who is not regarding the day, to the Lord he doth not regard [it]. He who is eating, to the Lord he doth eat, for he doth give thanks to God; and he who is not eating, to the Lord he doth not eat, and doth give thanks to God.

<sup>7</sup> For none of us to himself doth live, and none to himself doth die;

<sup>8</sup> for both, if we may live, to the Lord we live; if also we may die, to the Lord we die; both then if we may live, also if we may die, we are the Lord's;

<sup>9</sup> for because of this Christ both died and rose again, and lived again, that both of dead and of living he may be Lord.

<sup>10</sup> And thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? or again, thou, why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand at the tribunal of the Christ;

<sup>11</sup> for it hath been written, 'I live! saith the Lord — to Me bow shall every knee, and every tongue shall confess to God;'

<sup>12</sup> so, then, each of us concerning himself shall give reckoning to God;

<sup>13</sup> no longer, therefore, may we judge one another, but this judge ye rather, not to put a stumbling-stone before the brother, or an offence.

<sup>14</sup> I have known, and am persuaded, in the Lord Jesus, that nothing [is] unclean of itself, except to him who is reckoning anything to be unclean — to that one [it is] unclean;

<sup>15</sup> and if through victuals thy brother is grieved, no more dost thou walk according to love; do not with thy victuals destroy that one for whom Christ died.

<sup>16</sup> Let not, then, your good be evil spoken of,

<sup>17</sup> for the reign of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit;

<sup>18</sup> for he who in these things is serving the Christ, [is] acceptable to God and approved of men.

<sup>19</sup> So, then, the things of peace may we pursue, and the things of building up one another;

<sup>20</sup> for the sake of victuals cast not down the work of God; all things, indeed, [are] pure, but evil [is] to the man who is eating through stumbling.

<sup>21</sup> Right [it is] not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to [do anything] in which thy brother doth stumble, or is made to fall, or is weak.

<sup>22</sup> Thou hast faith! to thyself have [it] before God; happy is he who is not judging himself in what he doth approve,

<sup>23</sup> and he who is making a difference, if he may eat, hath been condemned, because [it is] not of faith; and all that [is] not of faith is sin.
