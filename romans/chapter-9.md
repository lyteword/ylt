# Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> Truth I say in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing testimony with me in the Holy Spirit,

<sup>2</sup> that I have great grief and unceasing pain in my heart —

<sup>3</sup> for I was wishing, I myself, to be anathema from the Christ — for my brethren, my kindred, according to the flesh,

<sup>4</sup> who are Israelites, whose [is] the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the lawgiving, and the service, and the promises,

<sup>5</sup> whose [are] the fathers, and of whom [is] the Christ, according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed to the ages. Amen.

<sup>6</sup> And it is not possible that the word of God hath failed; for not all who [are] of Israel are these Israel;

<sup>7</sup> nor because they are seed of Abraham [are] all children, but — 'in Isaac shall a seed be called to thee;'

<sup>8</sup> that is, the children of the flesh — these [are] not children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned for seed;

<sup>9</sup> for the word of promise [is] this; 'According to this time I will come, and there shall be to Sarah a son.'

<sup>10</sup> And not only [so], but also Rebecca, having conceived by one — Isaac our father —

<sup>11</sup> (for they being not yet born, neither having done anything good or evil, that the purpose of God, according to choice, might remain; not of works, but of Him who is calling,) it was said to her —

<sup>12</sup> 'The greater shall serve the less;'

<sup>13</sup> according as it hath been written, 'Jacob I did love, and Esau I did hate.'

<sup>14</sup> What, then, shall we say? unrighteousness [is] with God? let it not be!

<sup>15</sup> for to Moses He saith, 'I will do kindness to whom I do kindness, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion;'

<sup>16</sup> so, then — not of him who is willing, nor of him who is running, but of God who is doing kindness:

<sup>17</sup> for the Writing saith to Pharaoh — 'For this very thing I did raise thee up, that I might shew in thee My power, and that My name might be declared in all the land;'

<sup>18</sup> so, then, to whom He willeth, He doth kindness, and to whom He willeth, He doth harden.

<sup>19</sup> Thou wilt say, then, to me, 'Why yet doth He find fault? for His counsel who hath resisted?'

<sup>20</sup> nay, but, O man, who art thou that art answering again to God? shall the thing formed say to Him who did form [it], Why me didst thou make thus?

<sup>21</sup> hath not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make the one vessel to honour, and the one to dishonour?

<sup>22</sup> And if God, willing to shew the wrath and to make known His power, did endure, in much long suffering, vessels of wrath fitted for destruction,

<sup>23</sup> and that He might make known the riches of His glory on vessels of kindness, that He before prepared for glory, whom also He did call — us —

<sup>24</sup> not only out of Jews, but also out of nations,

<sup>25</sup> as also in Hosea He saith, 'I will call what [is] not My people — My people; and her not beloved — Beloved,

<sup>26</sup> and it shall be — in the place where it was said to them, Ye [are] not My people; there they shall be called sons of the living God.'

<sup>27</sup> And Isaiah doth cry concerning Israel, 'If the number of the sons of Israel may be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved;

<sup>28</sup> for a matter He is finishing, and is cutting short in righteousness, because a matter cut short will the Lord do upon the land.

<sup>29</sup> and according as Isaiah saith before, 'Except the Lord of Sabaoth did leave to us a seed, as Sodom we had become, and as Gomorrah we had been made like.'

<sup>30</sup> What, then, shall we say? that nations who are not pursuing righteousness did attain to righteousness, and righteousness that [is] of faith,

<sup>31</sup> and Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, at a law of righteousness did not arrive;

<sup>32</sup> wherefore? because — not by faith, but as by works of law; for they did stumble at the stone of stumbling,

<sup>33</sup> according as it hath been written, 'Lo, I place in Sion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence; and every one who is believing thereon shall not be ashamed.'
