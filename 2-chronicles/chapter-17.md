# Chapter 17

<sup>1</sup> And Jehoshaphat his son reigneth in his stead, and he strengtheneth himself against Israel,

<sup>2</sup> and putteth a force in all the fenced cities of Judah, and putteth garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim that Asa his father had captured.

<sup>3</sup> And Jehovah is with Jehoshaphat, for he hath walked in the first ways of David his father, and hath not sought to Baalim,

<sup>4</sup> for to the God of his father he hath sought, and in His commands he hath walked, and not according to the work of Israel.

<sup>5</sup> And Jehovah doth establish the kingdom in his hand, and all Judah give a present to Jehoshaphat, and he hath riches and honour in abundance,

<sup>6</sup> and his heart is high in the ways of Jehovah, and again he hath turned aside the high places and the shrines out of Judah.

<sup>7</sup> And in the third year of his reign he hath sent for his heads, for Ben-Hail, and for Obadiah, and for Zechariah, and for Nethaneel, and for Michaiah, to teach in cities of Judah,

<sup>8</sup> and with them the Levites, Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijath, and Tob-Adonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.

<sup>9</sup> And they teach in Judah, and with them [is] the Book of the Law of Jehovah, and they go round about into all cities of Judah, and teach among the people.

<sup>10</sup> And here is a fear of Jehovah on all kingdoms of the lands that [are] round about Judah, and they have not fought with Jehoshaphat;

<sup>11</sup> and of the Philistines they are bringing in to Jehoshaphat a present, and tribute silver; also, the Arabians are bringing to him a flock, rams seven thousand an seven hundred, and he-goats seven thousand and seven hundred.

<sup>12</sup> And Jehoshaphat is going on and becoming very great, and he buildeth in Judah palaces and cities of store,

<sup>13</sup> and he hath much work in cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty of valour, [are] in Jerusalem.

<sup>14</sup> And these [are] their numbers, for the house of their fathers: Of Judah, heads of thousands, Adnah the head, and with him mighty ones of valour, three hundred chiefs.

<sup>15</sup> And at his hand [is] Jehohanan the head, and with him two hundred and eighty chiefs.

<sup>16</sup> And at his hand [is] Amasiah son of Zichri, who is willingly offering himself to Jehovah, and with him two hundred chiefs, mighty of valour.

<sup>17</sup> And of Benjamin: mighty of valour, Eliada, and with him, armed with bow and shield, two hundred chiefs.

<sup>18</sup> And at his hand [is] Jehozabad, and with him a hundred and eighty chiefs, armed ones of the host.

<sup>19</sup> These [are] those serving the king, apart from those whom the king put in the cities of fortress, in all Judah.
