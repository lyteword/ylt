# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> And I say, so long time as the heir is a babe, he differeth nothing from a servant — being lord of all,

<sup>2</sup> but is under tutors and stewards till the time appointed of the father,

<sup>3</sup> so also we, when we were babes, under the elements of the world were in servitude,

<sup>4</sup> and when the fulness of time did come, God sent forth His Son, come of a woman, come under law,

<sup>5</sup> that those under law he may redeem, that the adoption of sons we may receive;

<sup>6</sup> and because ye are sons, God did send forth the spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, 'Abba, Father!'

<sup>7</sup> so that thou art no more a servant, but a son, and if a son, also an heir of God through Christ.

<sup>8</sup> But then, indeed, not having known God, ye were in servitude to those not by nature gods,

<sup>9</sup> and now, having known God — and rather being known by God — how turn ye again unto the weak and poor elements to which anew ye desire to be in servitude?

<sup>10</sup> days ye observe, and months, and times, and years!

<sup>11</sup> I am afraid of you, lest in vain I did labour toward you.

<sup>12</sup> Become as I [am] — because I also [am] as ye brethren, I beseech you; to me ye did no hurt,

<sup>13</sup> and ye have known that through infirmity of the flesh I did proclaim good news to you at the first,

<sup>14</sup> and my trial that [is] in my flesh ye did not despise nor reject, but as a messenger of God ye did receive me — as Christ Jesus;

<sup>15</sup> what then was your happiness? for I testify to you, that if possible, your eyes having plucked out, ye would have given to me;

<sup>16</sup> so that your enemy have I become, being true to you?

<sup>17</sup> they are zealous for you — [yet] not well, but they wish to shut us out, that for them ye may be zealous;

<sup>18</sup> and [it is] good to be zealously regarded, in what is good, at all times, and not only in my being present with you;

<sup>19</sup> my little children, of whom again I travail in birth, till Christ may be formed in you,

<sup>20</sup> and I was wishing to be present with you now, and to change my voice, because I am in doubt about you.

<sup>21</sup> Tell me, ye who are willing to be under law, the law do ye not hear?

<sup>22</sup> for it hath been written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the maid-servant, and one by the free-woman,

<sup>23</sup> but he who [is] of the maid-servant, according to flesh hath been, and he who [is] of the free-woman, through the promise;

<sup>24</sup> which things are allegorized, for these are the two covenants: one, indeed, from mount Sinai, to servitude bringing forth, which is Hagar;

<sup>25</sup> for this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and doth correspond to the Jerusalem that now [is], and is in servitude with her children,

<sup>26</sup> and the Jerusalem above is the free-woman, which is mother of us all,

<sup>27</sup> for it hath been written, 'Rejoice, O barren, who art not bearing; break forth and cry, thou who art not travailing, because many [are] the children of the desolate — more than of her having the husband.'

<sup>28</sup> And we, brethren, as Isaac, are children of promise,

<sup>29</sup> but as then he who was born according to the flesh did persecute him according to the spirit, so also now;

<sup>30</sup> but what saith the Writing? 'Cast forth the maid-servant and her son, for the son of the maid-servant may not be heir with the son of the free-woman;'

<sup>31</sup> then, brethren, we are not a maid-servant's children, but the free-woman's.
