# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Paul, an apostle — not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who did raise him out of the dead —

<sup>2</sup> and all the brethren with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:

<sup>3</sup> Grace to you, and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,

<sup>4</sup> who did give himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of the present evil age, according to the will of God even our Father,

<sup>5</sup> to whom [is] the glory to the ages of the ages. Amen.

<sup>6</sup> I wonder that ye are so quickly removed from Him who did call you in the grace of Christ to another good news;

<sup>7</sup> that is not another, except there be certain who are troubling you, and wishing to pervert the good news of the Christ;

<sup>8</sup> but even if we or a messenger out of heaven may proclaim good news to you different from what we did proclaim to you — anathema let him be!

<sup>9</sup> as we have said before, and now say again, If any one to you may proclaim good news different from what ye did receive — anathema let him be!

<sup>10</sup> for now men do I persuade, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if yet men I did please — Christ's servant I should not be.

<sup>11</sup> And I make known to you, brethren, the good news that were proclaimed by me, that it is not according to man,

<sup>12</sup> for neither did I from man receive it, nor was I taught [it], but through a revelation of Jesus Christ,

<sup>13</sup> for ye did hear of my behaviour once in Judaism, that exceedingly I was persecuting the assembly of God, and wasting it,

<sup>14</sup> and I was advancing in Judaism above many equals in age in mine own race, being more abundantly zealous of my fathers' deliverances,

<sup>15</sup> and when God was well pleased — having separated me from the womb of my mother, and having called [me] through His grace —

<sup>16</sup> to reveal His Son in me, that I might proclaim him good news among the nations, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood,

<sup>17</sup> nor did I go up to Jerusalem unto those who were apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus,

<sup>18</sup> then, after three years I went up to Jerusalem to enquire about Peter, and remained with him fifteen days,

<sup>19</sup> and other of the apostles I did not see, except James, the brother of the Lord.

<sup>20</sup> And the things that I write to you, lo, before God — I lie not;

<sup>21</sup> then I came to the regions of Syria and of Cilicia,

<sup>22</sup> and was unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea, that [are] in Christ,

<sup>23</sup> and only they were hearing, that 'he who is persecuting us then, doth now proclaim good news — the faith that then he was wasting;'

<sup>24</sup> and they were glorifying God in me.
