# Galatians 5 

**¹** In the freedom, then, with which Christ did make you free — stand ye, and be not held fast again by a yoke of servitude;

**²** lo, I Paul do say to you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing;

**³** and I testify again to every man circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law;

**⁴** ye were freed from the Christ, ye who in law are declared righteous; from the grace ye fell away;

**⁵** for we by the Spirit, by faith, a hope of righteousness do wait for,

**⁶** for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith through love working.

**⁷** Ye were running well; who did hinder you — not to obey the truth?

**⁸** the obedience [is] not of him who is calling you!

**⁹** a little leaven the whole lump doth leaven;

**¹⁰** I have confidence in regard to you in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded; and he who is troubling you shall bear the judgment, whoever he may be.

**¹¹** And I, brethren, if uncircumcision I yet preach, why yet am I persecuted? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been done away;

**¹²** O that even they would cut themselves off who are unsettling you!

**¹³** For ye — to freedom ye were called, brethren, only not the freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through the love serve ye one another,

**¹⁴** for all the law in one word is fulfilled — in this: 'Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;'

**¹⁵** and if one another ye do bite and devour, see — that ye may not by one another be consumed.

**¹⁶** And I say: In the Spirit walk ye, and the desire of the flesh ye may not complete;

**¹⁷** for the flesh doth desire contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit contrary to the flesh, and these are opposed one to another, that the things that ye may will — these ye may not do;

**¹⁸** and if by the Spirit ye are led, ye are not under law.

**¹⁹** And manifest also are the works of the flesh, which are: Adultery, whoredom, uncleanness, lasciviousness,

**²⁰** idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, strifes, emulations, wraths, rivalries, dissensions, sects,

**²¹** envyings, murders, drunkennesses, revellings, and such like, of which I tell you before, as I also said before, that those doing such things the reign of God shall not inherit.

**²²** And the fruit of the Spirit is: Love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith,

**²³** meekness, temperance: against such there is no law;

**²⁴** and those who are Christ's, the flesh did crucify with the affections, and the desires;

**²⁵** if we may live in the Spirit, in the Spirit also we may walk;

**²⁶** let us not become vain-glorious — one another provoking, one another envying!
