# Galatians 6 

**¹** Brethren, if a man also may be overtaken in any trespass, ye who [are] spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering thyself — lest thou also may be tempted;

**²** of one another the burdens bear ye, and so fill up the law of the Christ,

**³** for if any one doth think [himself] to be something — being nothing — himself he doth deceive;

**⁴** and his own work let each one prove, and then in regard to himself alone the glorying he shall have, and not in regard to the other,

**⁵** for each one his own burden shall bear.

**⁶** And let him who is instructed in the word share with him who is instructing — in all good things.

**⁷** Be not led astray; God is not mocked; for what a man may sow — that also he shall reap,

**⁸** because he who is sowing to his own flesh, of the flesh shall reap corruption; and he who is sowing to the Spirit, of the Spirit shall reap life age-during;

**⁹** and in the doing good we may not be faint-hearted, for at the proper time we shall reap — not desponding;

**¹⁰** therefore, then, as we have opportunity, may we work the good to all, and especially unto those of the household of the faith.

**¹¹** Ye see in how large letters I have written to you with my own hand;

**¹²** as many as are willing to make a good appearance in the flesh, these constrain you to be circumcised — only that for the cross of the Christ they may not be persecuted,

**¹³** for neither do those circumcised themselves keep the law, but they wish you to be circumcised, that in your flesh they may glory.

**¹⁴** And for me, let it not be — to glory, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which to me the world hath been crucified, and I to the world;

**¹⁵** for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation;

**¹⁶** and as many as by this rule do walk — peace upon them, and kindness, and on the Israel of God!

**¹⁷** Henceforth, let no one give me trouble, for I the scars of the Lord Jesus in my body do bear.

**¹⁸** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [is] with your spirit, brethren! Amen.
