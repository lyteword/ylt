# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> Remind them to be subject to principalities and authorities, to obey rule, unto every good work to be ready,

<sup>2</sup> of no one to speak evil, not to be quarrelsome — gentle, showing all meekness to all men,

<sup>3</sup> for we were once — also we — thoughtless, disobedient, led astray, serving desires and pleasures manifold, in malice and envy living, odious — hating one another;

<sup>4</sup> and when the kindness and the love to men of God our Saviour did appear

<sup>5</sup> (not by works that [are] in righteousness that we did but according to His kindness,) He did save us, through a bathing of regeneration, and a renewing of the Holy Spirit,

<sup>6</sup> which He poured upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour,

<sup>7</sup> that having been declared righteous by His grace, heirs we may become according to the hope of life age-during.

<sup>8</sup> Stedfast [is] the word; and concerning these things I counsel thee to affirm fully, that they may be thoughtful, to be leading in good works — who have believed God; these are the good and profitable things to men,

<sup>9</sup> and foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about law, stand away from — for they are unprofitable and vain.

<sup>10</sup> A sectarian man, after a first and second admonition be rejecting,

<sup>11</sup> having known that he hath been subverted who [is] such, and doth sin, being self-condemned.

<sup>12</sup> When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis, for there to winter I have determined.

<sup>13</sup> Zenas the lawyer and Apollos bring diligently on their way, that nothing to them may be lacking,

<sup>14</sup> and let them learn — ours also — to be leading in good works to the necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.

<sup>15</sup> Salute thee do all those with me; salute those loving us in faith; the grace [is] with you all!
