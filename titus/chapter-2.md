# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> And thou — be speaking what doth become the sound teaching;

<sup>2</sup> aged men to be temperate, grave, sober, sound in the faith, in the love, in the endurance;

<sup>3</sup> aged women, in like manner, in deportment as doth become sacred persons, not false accusers, to much wine not enslaved, of good things teachers,

<sup>4</sup> that they may make the young women sober-minded, to be lovers of [their] husbands, lovers of [their] children,

<sup>5</sup> sober, pure, keepers of [their own] houses, good, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be evil spoken of.

<sup>6</sup> The younger men, in like manner, be exhorting to be sober-minded;

<sup>7</sup> concerning all things thyself showing a pattern of good works; in the teaching uncorruptedness, gravity, incorruptibility,

<sup>8</sup> discourse sound, irreprehensible, that he who is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say concerning you.

<sup>9</sup> Servants — to their own masters [are] to be subject, in all things to be well-pleasing, not gainsaying,

<sup>10</sup> not purloining, but showing all good stedfastness, that the teaching of God our Saviour they may adorn in all things.

<sup>11</sup> For the saving grace of God was manifested to all men,

<sup>12</sup> teaching us, that denying the impiety and the worldly desires, soberly and righteously and piously we may live in the present age,

<sup>13</sup> waiting for the blessed hope and manifestation of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ,

<sup>14</sup> who did give himself for us, that he might ransom us from all lawlessness, and might purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works;

<sup>15</sup> these things be speaking, and exhorting, and convicting, with all charge; let no one despise thee!
