# Titus 2 

**¹** And thou — be speaking what doth become the sound teaching;

**²** aged men to be temperate, grave, sober, sound in the faith, in the love, in the endurance;

**³** aged women, in like manner, in deportment as doth become sacred persons, not false accusers, to much wine not enslaved, of good things teachers,

**⁴** that they may make the young women sober-minded, to be lovers of [their] husbands, lovers of [their] children,

**⁵** sober, pure, keepers of [their own] houses, good, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be evil spoken of.

**⁶** The younger men, in like manner, be exhorting to be sober-minded;

**⁷** concerning all things thyself showing a pattern of good works; in the teaching uncorruptedness, gravity, incorruptibility,

**⁸** discourse sound, irreprehensible, that he who is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say concerning you.

**⁹** Servants — to their own masters [are] to be subject, in all things to be well-pleasing, not gainsaying,

**¹⁰** not purloining, but showing all good stedfastness, that the teaching of God our Saviour they may adorn in all things.

**¹¹** For the saving grace of God was manifested to all men,

**¹²** teaching us, that denying the impiety and the worldly desires, soberly and righteously and piously we may live in the present age,

**¹³** waiting for the blessed hope and manifestation of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ,

**¹⁴** who did give himself for us, that he might ransom us from all lawlessness, and might purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works;

**¹⁵** these things be speaking, and exhorting, and convicting, with all charge; let no one despise thee!
