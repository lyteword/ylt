# Chapter 5

**¹** And concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need of my writing to you,

**²** for yourselves have known thoroughly that the day of the Lord as a thief in the night doth so come,

**³** for when they may say, Peace and surety, then sudden destruction doth stand by them, as the travail [doth] her who is with child, and they shall not escape;

**⁴** and ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day may catch you as a thief;

**⁵** all ye are sons of light, and sons of day; we are not of night, nor of darkness,

**⁶** so, then, we may not sleep as also the others, but watch and be sober,

**⁷** for those sleeping, by night do sleep, and those making themselves drunk, by night are drunken,

**⁸** and we, being of the day — let us be sober, putting on a breastplate of faith and love, and an helmet — a hope of salvation,

**⁹** because God did not appoint us to anger, but to the acquiring of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,

**¹⁰** who did die for us, that whether we wake — whether we sleep — together with him we may live;

**¹¹** wherefore, comfort ye one another, and build ye up, one the one, as also ye do.

**¹²** And we ask you, brethren, to know those labouring among you, and leading you in the Lord, and admonishing you,

**¹³** and to esteem them very abundantly in love, because of their work; be at peace among yourselves;

**¹⁴** and we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the infirm, be patient unto all;

**¹⁵** see no one evil for evil may render to any one, but always that which is good pursue ye, both to one another and to all;

**¹⁶** always rejoice ye;

**¹⁷** continually pray ye;

**¹⁸** in every thing give thanks, for this [is] the will of God in Christ Jesus in regard to you.

**¹⁹** The Spirit quench not;

**²⁰** prophesyings despise not;

**²¹** all things prove; that which is good hold fast;

**²²** from all appearance of evil abstain ye;

**²³** and the God of the peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your whole spirit, and soul, and body, be preserved unblameably in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ;

**²⁴** stedfast is He who is calling you, who also will do [it].

**²⁵** Brethren, pray for us;

**²⁶** salute all the brethren in an holy kiss;

**²⁷** I charge you [by] the Lord, that the letter be read to all the holy brethren;

**²⁸** the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [is] with you! Amen.
