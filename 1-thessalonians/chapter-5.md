# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> And concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need of my writing to you,

<sup>2</sup> for yourselves have known thoroughly that the day of the Lord as a thief in the night doth so come,

<sup>3</sup> for when they may say, Peace and surety, then sudden destruction doth stand by them, as the travail [doth] her who is with child, and they shall not escape;

<sup>4</sup> and ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day may catch you as a thief;

<sup>5</sup> all ye are sons of light, and sons of day; we are not of night, nor of darkness,

<sup>6</sup> so, then, we may not sleep as also the others, but watch and be sober,

<sup>7</sup> for those sleeping, by night do sleep, and those making themselves drunk, by night are drunken,

<sup>8</sup> and we, being of the day — let us be sober, putting on a breastplate of faith and love, and an helmet — a hope of salvation,

<sup>9</sup> because God did not appoint us to anger, but to the acquiring of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,

<sup>10</sup> who did die for us, that whether we wake — whether we sleep — together with him we may live;

<sup>11</sup> wherefore, comfort ye one another, and build ye up, one the one, as also ye do.

<sup>12</sup> And we ask you, brethren, to know those labouring among you, and leading you in the Lord, and admonishing you,

<sup>13</sup> and to esteem them very abundantly in love, because of their work; be at peace among yourselves;

<sup>14</sup> and we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the infirm, be patient unto all;

<sup>15</sup> see no one evil for evil may render to any one, but always that which is good pursue ye, both to one another and to all;

<sup>16</sup> always rejoice ye;

<sup>17</sup> continually pray ye;

<sup>18</sup> in every thing give thanks, for this [is] the will of God in Christ Jesus in regard to you.

<sup>19</sup> The Spirit quench not;

<sup>20</sup> prophesyings despise not;

<sup>21</sup> all things prove; that which is good hold fast;

<sup>22</sup> from all appearance of evil abstain ye;

<sup>23</sup> and the God of the peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your whole spirit, and soul, and body, be preserved unblameably in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ;

<sup>24</sup> stedfast is He who is calling you, who also will do [it].

<sup>25</sup> Brethren, pray for us;

<sup>26</sup> salute all the brethren in an holy kiss;

<sup>27</sup> I charge you [by] the Lord, that the letter be read to all the holy brethren;

<sup>28</sup> the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [is] with you! Amen.
