# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> I exhort, then, first of all, there be made supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, for all men:

<sup>2</sup> for kings, and all who are in authority, that a quiet and peaceable life we may lead in all piety and gravity,

<sup>3</sup> for this [is] right and acceptable before God our Saviour,

<sup>4</sup> who doth will all men to be saved, and to come to the full knowledge of the truth;

<sup>5</sup> for one [is] God, one also [is] mediator of God and of men, the man Christ Jesus,

<sup>6</sup> who did give himself a ransom for all — the testimony in its own times —

<sup>7</sup> in regard to which I was set a preacher and apostle — truth I say in Christ, I do not lie — a teacher of nations, in faith and truth.

<sup>8</sup> I wish, therefore, that men pray in every place, lifting up kind hands, apart from anger and reasoning;

<sup>9</sup> in like manner also the women, in becoming apparel, with modesty and sobriety to adorn themselves, not in braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or garments of great price,

<sup>10</sup> but — which becometh women professing godly piety — through good works.

<sup>11</sup> Let a woman in quietness learn in all subjection,

<sup>12</sup> and a woman I do not suffer to teach, nor to rule a husband, but to be in quietness,

<sup>13</sup> for Adam was first formed, then Eve,

<sup>14</sup> and Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, into transgression came,

<sup>15</sup> and she shall be saved through the child-bearing, if they remain in faith, and love, and sanctification, with sobriety.
