# Chapter 2

**¹** I exhort, then, first of all, there be made supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, for all men:

**²** for kings, and all who are in authority, that a quiet and peaceable life we may lead in all piety and gravity,

**³** for this [is] right and acceptable before God our Saviour,

**⁴** who doth will all men to be saved, and to come to the full knowledge of the truth;

**⁵** for one [is] God, one also [is] mediator of God and of men, the man Christ Jesus,

**⁶** who did give himself a ransom for all — the testimony in its own times —

**⁷** in regard to which I was set a preacher and apostle — truth I say in Christ, I do not lie — a teacher of nations, in faith and truth.

**⁸** I wish, therefore, that men pray in every place, lifting up kind hands, apart from anger and reasoning;

**⁹** in like manner also the women, in becoming apparel, with modesty and sobriety to adorn themselves, not in braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or garments of great price,

**¹⁰** but — which becometh women professing godly piety — through good works.

**¹¹** Let a woman in quietness learn in all subjection,

**¹²** and a woman I do not suffer to teach, nor to rule a husband, but to be in quietness,

**¹³** for Adam was first formed, then Eve,

**¹⁴** and Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, into transgression came,

**¹⁵** and she shall be saved through the child-bearing, if they remain in faith, and love, and sanctification, with sobriety.
