# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> Stedfast [is] the word: If any one the oversight doth long for, a right work he desireth;

<sup>2</sup> it behoveth, therefore, the overseer to be blameless, of one wife a husband, vigilant, sober, decent, a friend of strangers, apt to teach,

<sup>3</sup> not given to wine, not a striker, not given to filthy lucre, but gentle, not contentious, not a lover of money,

<sup>4</sup> his own house leading well, having children in subjection with all gravity,

<sup>5</sup> (and if any one his own house [how] to lead hath not known, how an assembly of God shall he take care of?)

<sup>6</sup> not a new convert, lest having been puffed up he may fall to a judgment of the devil;

<sup>7</sup> and it behoveth him also to have a good testimony from those without, that he may not fall into reproach and a snare of the devil.

<sup>8</sup> Ministrants — in like manner grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not given to filthy lucre,

<sup>9</sup> having the secret of the faith in a pure conscience,

<sup>10</sup> and let these also first be proved, then let them minister, being unblameable.

<sup>11</sup> Women — in like manner grave, not false accusers, vigilant, faithful in all things.

<sup>12</sup> Ministrants — let them be of one wife husbands; the children leading well, and their own houses,

<sup>13</sup> for those who did minister well a good step to themselves do acquire, and much boldness in faith that [is] in Christ Jesus.

<sup>14</sup> These things I write to thee, hoping to come unto thee soon,

<sup>15</sup> and if I delay, that thou mayest know how it behoveth [thee] to conduct thyself in the house of God, which is an assembly of the living God — a pillar and foundation of the truth,

<sup>16</sup> and, confessedly, great is the secret of piety — God was manifested in flesh, declared righteous in spirit, seen by messengers, preached among nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory!
