# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> An aged person thou mayest not rebuke, but be entreating as a father; younger persons as brethren;

<sup>2</sup> aged women as mothers, younger ones as sisters — in all purity;

<sup>3</sup> honour widows who are really widows;

<sup>4</sup> and if any widow have children or grandchildren, let them learn first to their own house to show piety, and to give back a recompense to the parents, for this is right and acceptable before God.

<sup>5</sup> And she who is really a widow and desolate, hath hoped upon God, and doth remain in the supplications and in the prayers night and day,

<sup>6</sup> and she who is given to luxury, living — hath died;

<sup>7</sup> and these things charge, that they may be blameless;

<sup>8</sup> and if any one for his own — and especially for those of the household — doth not provide, the faith he hath denied, and than an unbeliever he is worse.

<sup>9</sup> A widow — let her not be enrolled under sixty years of age, having been a wife of one husband,

<sup>10</sup> in good works being testified to: if she brought up children, if she entertained strangers, if saints' feet she washed, if those in tribulation she relieved, if every good work she followed after;

<sup>11</sup> and younger widows be refusing, for when they may revel against the Christ, they wish to marry,

<sup>12</sup> having judgment, because the first faith they did cast away,

<sup>13</sup> and at the same time also, they learn [to be] idle, going about the houses; and not only idle, but also tattlers and busybodies, speaking the things they ought not;

<sup>14</sup> I wish, therefore, younger ones to marry, to bear children, to be mistress of the house, to give no occasion to the opposer to reviling;

<sup>15</sup> for already certain did turn aside after the Adversary.

<sup>16</sup> If any believing man or believing woman have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the assembly be burdened, that those really widows it may relieve.

<sup>17</sup> The well-leading elders of double honour let them be counted worthy, especially those labouring in word and teaching,

<sup>18</sup> for the Writing saith, 'An ox treading out thou shalt not muzzle,' and 'Worthy [is] the workman of his reward.'

<sup>19</sup> Against an elder an accusation receive not, except upon two or three witnesses.

<sup>20</sup> Those sinning, reprove before all, that the others also may have fear;

<sup>21</sup> I testify fully, before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the choice messengers, that these things thou mayest keep, without forejudging, doing nothing by partiality.

<sup>22</sup> Be laying hands quickly on no one, nor be having fellowship with sins of others; be keeping thyself pure;

<sup>23</sup> no longer be drinking water, but a little wine be using, because of thy stomach and of thine often infirmities;

<sup>24</sup> of certain men the sins are manifest beforehand, leading before to judgment, and certain also they follow after;

<sup>25</sup> in like manner also the right works are manifest beforehand, and those that are otherwise are not able to be hid.
