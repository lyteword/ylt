# Jeremiah 45 

**¹** The word that Jeremiah the prophet hath spoken unto Baruch son of Neriah, in his writing these words on a book from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, saying:

**²** 'Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, concerning thee, O Baruch:

**³** 'Thou hast said, Woe to me, now, for Jehovah hath added sorrow to my pain, I have been wearied with my sighing, and rest I have not found.

**⁴** Thus dost thou say unto him: Thus said Jehovah: Lo, that which I have built I am throwing down, and that which I have planted I am plucking up, even the whole land itself.

**⁵** And thou — thou seekest for thee great things — do not seek, for lo, I am bringing in evil on all flesh — an affirmation of Jehovah — and I have given to thee thy life for a spoil, in all places whither thou goest.'
