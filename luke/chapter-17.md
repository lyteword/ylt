# Chapter 17

<sup>1</sup> And he said unto the disciples, 'It is impossible for the stumbling blocks not to come, but woe [to him] through whom they come;

<sup>2</sup> it is more profitable to him if a weighty millstone is put round about his neck, and he hath been cast into the sea, than that he may cause one of these little ones to stumble.

<sup>3</sup> 'Take heed to yourselves, and, if thy brother may sin in regard to thee, rebuke him, and if he may reform, forgive him,

<sup>4</sup> and if seven times in the day he may sin against thee, and seven times in the day may turn back to thee, saying, I reform; thou shalt forgive him.'

<sup>5</sup> And the apostles said to the Lord, 'Add to us faith;'

<sup>6</sup> and the Lord said, 'If ye had faith as a grain of mustard, ye would have said to this sycamine, Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea, and it would have obeyed you.

<sup>7</sup> 'But, who is he of you — having a servant ploughing or feeding — who, to him having come in out of the field, will say, Having come near, recline at meat?

<sup>8</sup> but will not [rather] say to him, Prepare what I may sup, and having girded thyself about, minister to me, till I eat and drink, and after these things thou shalt eat and drink?

<sup>9</sup> Hath he favour to that servant because he did the things directed? I think not.

<sup>10</sup> 'So also ye, when ye may have done all the things directed you, say — We are unprofitable servants, because that which we owed to do — we have done.'

<sup>11</sup> And it came to pass, in his going on to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee,

<sup>12</sup> and he entering into a certain village, there met him ten leprous men, who stood afar off,

<sup>13</sup> and they lifted up the voice, saying, 'Jesus, master, deal kindly with us;'

<sup>14</sup> and having seen [them], he said to them, 'Having gone on, shew yourselves to the priests;' and it came to pass, in their going, they were cleansed,

<sup>15</sup> and one of them having seen that he was healed did turn back, with a loud voice glorifying God,

<sup>16</sup> and he fell upon [his] face at his feet, giving thanks to him, and he was a Samaritan.

<sup>17</sup> And Jesus answering said, 'Were not the ten cleansed, and the nine — where?

<sup>18</sup> There were not found who did turn back to give glory to God, except this alien;'

<sup>19</sup> and he said to him, 'Having risen, be going on, thy faith hath saved thee.'

<sup>20</sup> And having been questioned by the Pharisees, when the reign of God doth come, he answered them, and said, 'The reign of God doth not come with observation;

<sup>21</sup> nor shall they say, Lo, here; or lo, there; for lo, the reign of God is within you.'

<sup>22</sup> And he said unto his disciples, 'Days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and ye shall not behold [it];

<sup>23</sup> and they shall say to you, Lo, here; or lo, there; ye may not go away, nor follow;

<sup>24</sup> for as the lightning that is lightening out of the one [part] under heaven, to the other part under heaven doth shine, so shall be also the Son of Man in his day;

<sup>25</sup> and first it behoveth him to suffer many things, and to be rejected by this generation.

<sup>26</sup> 'And, as it came to pass in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man;

<sup>27</sup> they were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were given in marriage, till the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the deluge came, and destroyed all;

<sup>28</sup> in like manner also, as it came to pass in the days of Lot; they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building;

<sup>29</sup> and on the day Lot went forth from Sodom, He rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed all.

<sup>30</sup> 'According to these things it shall be, in the day the Son of Man is revealed;

<sup>31</sup> in that day, he who shall be on the house top, and his vessels in the house, let him not come down to take them away; and he in the field, in like manner, let him not turn backward;

<sup>32</sup> remember the wife of Lot.

<sup>33</sup> Whoever may seek to save his life, shall lose it; and whoever may lose it, shall preserve it.

<sup>34</sup> 'I say to you, In that night, there shall be two men on one couch, the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left;

<sup>35</sup> two women shall be grinding at the same place together, the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left;

<sup>36</sup> two men shall be in the field, the one shall be taken, and the other left.'

<sup>37</sup> And they answering say to him, 'Where, sir?' and he said to them, 'Where the body [is], there will the eagles be gathered together.'
