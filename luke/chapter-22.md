# Chapter 22

<sup>1</sup> And the feast of the unleavened food was coming nigh, that is called Passover,

<sup>2</sup> and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they may take him up, for they were afraid of the people.

<sup>3</sup> And the Adversary entered into Judas, who is surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve,

<sup>4</sup> and he, having gone away, spake with the chief priests and the magistrates, how he might deliver him up to them,

<sup>5</sup> and they rejoiced, and covenanted to give him money,

<sup>6</sup> and he agreed, and was seeking a favourable season to deliver him up to them without tumult.

<sup>7</sup> And the day of the unleavened food came, in which it was behoving the passover to be sacrificed,

<sup>8</sup> and he sent Peter and John, saying, 'Having gone on, prepare to us the passover, that we may eat;'

<sup>9</sup> and they said to him, 'Where wilt thou that we might prepare?'

<sup>10</sup> And he said to them, 'Lo, in your entering into the city, there shall meet you a man, bearing a pitcher of water, follow him to the house where he doth go in,

<sup>11</sup> and ye shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher saith to thee, Where is the guest-chamber where the passover with my disciples I may eat?

<sup>12</sup> and he shall show you a large upper room furnished, there make ready;'

<sup>13</sup> and they, having gone away, found as he hath said to them, and they made ready the passover.

<sup>14</sup> And when the hour come, he reclined (at meat), and the twelve apostles with him,

<sup>15</sup> and he said unto them, 'With desire I did desire to eat this passover with you before my suffering,

<sup>16</sup> for I say to you, that no more may I eat of it till it may be fulfilled in the reign of God.'

<sup>17</sup> And having taken a cup, having given thanks, he said, 'Take this and divide to yourselves,

<sup>18</sup> for I say to you that I may not drink of the produce of the vine till the reign of God may come.'

<sup>19</sup> And having taken bread, having given thanks, he brake and gave to them, saying, 'This is my body, that for you is being given, this do ye — to remembrance of me.'

<sup>20</sup> In like manner, also, the cup after the supping, saying, 'This cup [is] the new covenant in my blood, that for you is being poured forth.

<sup>21</sup> 'But, lo, the hand of him delivering me up [is] with me on the table,

<sup>22</sup> and indeed the Son of Man doth go according to what hath been determined; but woe to that man through whom he is being delivered up.'

<sup>23</sup> And they began to reason among themselves, who then of them it may be, who is about to do this thing.

<sup>24</sup> And there happened also a strife among them — who of them is accounted to be greater.

<sup>25</sup> And he said to them, 'The kings of the nations do exercise lordship over them, and those exercising authority upon them are called benefactors;

<sup>26</sup> but ye [are] not so, but he who is greater among you — let him be as the younger; and he who is leading, as he who is ministering;

<sup>27</sup> for who is greater? he who is reclining (at meat), or he who is ministering? is it not he who is reclining (at meat)? and I — I am in your midst as he who is ministering.

<sup>28</sup> 'And ye — ye are those who have remained with me in my temptations,

<sup>29</sup> and I appoint to you, as my Father did appoint to me, a kingdom,

<sup>30</sup> that ye may eat and may drink at my table, in my kingdom, and may sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.'

<sup>31</sup> And the Lord said, 'Simon, Simon, lo, the Adversary did ask you for himself to sift as the wheat,

<sup>32</sup> and I besought for thee, that thy faith may not fail; and thou, when thou didst turn, strengthen thy brethren.'

<sup>33</sup> And he said to him, 'Sir, with thee I am ready both to prison and to death to go;'

<sup>34</sup> and he said, 'I say to thee, Peter, a cock shall not crow to-day, before thrice thou mayest disown knowing me.'

<sup>35</sup> And he said to them, 'When I sent you without bag, and scrip, and sandals, did ye lack anything?' and they said, 'Nothing.'

<sup>36</sup> Then said he to them, 'But, now, he who is having a bag, let him take [it] up, and in like manner also a scrip; and he who is not having, let him sell his garment, and buy a sword,

<sup>37</sup> for I say to you, that yet this that hath been written it behoveth to be fulfilled in me: And with lawless ones he was reckoned, for also the things concerning me have an end.'

<sup>38</sup> And they said, 'Sir, lo, here [are] two swords;' and he said to them, 'It is sufficient.'

<sup>39</sup> And having gone forth, he went on, according to custom, to the mount of the Olives, and his disciples also followed him,

<sup>40</sup> and having come to the place, he said to them, 'Pray ye not to enter into temptation.'

<sup>41</sup> And he was withdrawn from them, as it were a stone's cast, and having fallen on the knees he was praying,

<sup>42</sup> saying, 'Father, if Thou be counselling to make this cup pass from me — ;but, not my will, but Thine be done.' —

<sup>43</sup> And there appeared to him a messenger from heaven strengthening him;

<sup>44</sup> and having been in agony, he was more earnestly praying, and his sweat became, as it were, great drops of blood falling upon the ground.

<sup>45</sup> And having risen up from the prayer, having come unto the disciples, he found them sleeping from the sorrow,

<sup>46</sup> and he said to them, 'Why do ye sleep? having risen, pray that ye may not enter into temptation.'

<sup>47</sup> And while he is speaking, lo, a multitude, and he who is called Judas, one of the twelve, was coming before them, and he came nigh to Jesus to kiss him,

<sup>48</sup> and Jesus said to him, 'Judas, with a kiss the Son of Man dost thou deliver up?'

<sup>49</sup> And those about him, having seen what was about to be, said to him, 'Sir, shall we smite with a sword?'

<sup>50</sup> And a certain one of them smote the servant of the chief priest, and took off his right ear,

<sup>51</sup> and Jesus answering said, 'Suffer ye thus far,' and having touched his ear, he healed him.

<sup>52</sup> And Jesus said to those having come upon him — chief priests, and magistrates of the temple, and elders — 'As upon a robber have ye come forth, with swords and sticks?

<sup>53</sup> while daily I was with you in the temple, ye did stretch forth no hands against me; but this is your hour and the power of the darkness.'

<sup>54</sup> And having taken him, they led and brought him to the house of the chief priest. And Peter was following afar off,

<sup>55</sup> and they having kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and having sat down together, Peter was sitting in the midst of them,

<sup>56</sup> and a certain maid having seen him sitting at the light, and having earnestly looked at him, she said, 'And this one was with him!'

<sup>57</sup> and he disowned him, saying, 'Woman, I have not known him.'

<sup>58</sup> And after a little, another having seen him, said, 'And thou art of them!' and Peter said, 'Man, I am not.'

<sup>59</sup> And one hour, as it were, having intervened, a certain other was confidently affirming, saying, 'Of a truth this one also was with him, for he is also a Galilean;'

<sup>60</sup> and Peter said, 'Man, I have not known what thou sayest;' and presently, while he is speaking, a cock crew.

<sup>61</sup> And the Lord having turned did look on Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him — 'Before a cock shall crow, thou mayest disown me thrice;'

<sup>62</sup> and Peter having gone without, wept bitterly.

<sup>63</sup> And the men who were holding Jesus were mocking him, beating [him];

<sup>64</sup> and having blindfolded him, they were striking him on the face, and were questioning him, saying, 'Prophesy who he is who smote thee?'

<sup>65</sup> and many other things, speaking evilly, they spake in regard to him.

<sup>66</sup> And when it became day there was gathered together the eldership of the people, chief priests also, and scribes, and they led him up to their own sanhedrim,

<sup>67</sup> saying, 'If thou be the Christ, tell us.' And he said to them, 'If I may tell you, ye will not believe;

<sup>68</sup> and if I also question [you], ye will not answer me or send me away;

<sup>69</sup> henceforth, there shall be the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the power of God.'

<sup>70</sup> And they all said, 'Thou, then, art the Son of God?' and he said unto them, 'Ye say [it], because I am;'

<sup>71</sup> and they said, 'What need yet have we of testimony? for we ourselves did hear [it] from his mouth.'
