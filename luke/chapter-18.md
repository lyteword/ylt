# Luke 18 

**¹** And he spake also a simile to them, that it behoveth [us] always to pray, and not to faint,

**²** saying, 'A certain judge was in a certain city — God he is not fearing, and man he is not regarding —

**³** and a widow was in that city, and she was coming unto him, saying, Do me justice on my opponent,

**⁴** and he would not for a time, but after these things he said in himself, Even if God I do not fear, and man do not regard,

**⁵** yet because this widow doth give me trouble, I will do her justice, lest, perpetually coming, she may plague me.'

**⁶** And the Lord said, 'Hear ye what the unrighteous judge saith:

**⁷** and shall not God execute the justice to His choice ones, who are crying unto Him day and night — bearing long in regard to them?

**⁸** I say to you, that He will execute the justice to them quickly; but the Son of Man having come, shall he find the faith upon the earth?'

**⁹** And he spake also unto certain who have been trusting in themselves that they were righteous, and have been despising the rest, this simile:

**¹⁰** 'Two men went up to the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax-gatherer;

**¹¹** the Pharisee having stood by himself, thus prayed: God, I thank Thee that I am not as the rest of men, rapacious, unrighteous, adulterers, or even as this tax-gatherer;

**¹²** I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all things — as many as I possess.

**¹³** 'And the tax-gatherer, having stood afar off, would not even the eyes lift up to the heaven, but was smiting on his breast, saying, God be propitious to me — the sinner!

**¹⁴** I say to you, this one went down declared righteous, to his house, rather than that one: for every one who is exalting himself shall be humbled, and he who is humbling himself shall be exalted.'

**¹⁵** And they were bringing near also the babes, that he may touch them, and the disciples having seen did rebuke them,

**¹⁶** and Jesus having called them near, said, 'Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the reign of God;

**¹⁷** verily I say to you, Whoever may not receive the reign of God as a little child, may not enter into it.'

**¹⁸** And a certain ruler questioned him, saying, 'Good teacher, what having done — shall I inherit life age-during?'

**¹⁹** And Jesus said to him, 'Why me dost thou call good? no one [is] good, except One — God;

**²⁰** the commands thou hast known: Thou mayest not commit adultery, Thou mayest do no murder, Thou mayest not steal, Thou mayest not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.'

**²¹** And he said, 'All these I did keep from my youth;'

**²²** and having heard these things, Jesus said to him, 'Yet one thing to thee is lacking; all things — as many as thou hast — sell, and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come, be following me;'

**²³** and he, having heard these things, became very sorrowful, for he was exceeding rich.

**²⁴** And Jesus having seen him become very sorrowful, said, 'How hardly shall those having riches enter into the reign of God!

**²⁵** for it is easier for a camel through the eye of a needle to enter, than for a rich man into the reign of God to enter.'

**²⁶** And those who heard, said, 'And who is able to be saved?'

**²⁷** and he said, 'The things impossible with men are possible with God.'

**²⁸** And Peter said, 'Lo, we left all, and did follow thee;'

**²⁹** and he said to them, 'Verily I say to you, that there is not one who left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, for the sake of the reign of God,

**³⁰** who may not receive back manifold more in this time, and in the coming age, life age-during.'

**³¹** And having taken the twelve aside, he said unto them, 'Lo, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things shall be completed — that have been written through the prophets — to the Son of Man,

**³²** for he shall be delivered up to the nations, and shall be mocked, and insulted, and spit upon,

**³³** and having scourged they shall put him to death, and on the third day he shall rise again.'

**³⁴** And they none of these things understood, and this saying was hid from them, and they were not knowing the things said.

**³⁵** And it came to pass, in his coming nigh to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting beside the way begging,

**³⁶** and having heard a multitude going by, he was inquiring what this may be,

**³⁷** and they brought him word that Jesus the Nazarene doth pass by,

**³⁸** and he cried out, saying, 'Jesus, Son of David, deal kindly with me;'

**³⁹** and those going before were rebuking him, that he might be silent, but he was much more crying out, 'Son of David, deal kindly with me.'

**⁴⁰** And Jesus having stood, commanded him to be brought unto him, and he having come nigh, he questioned him,

**⁴¹** saying, 'What wilt thou I shall do to thee?' and he said, 'Sir, that I may receive sight.'

**⁴²** And Jesus said to him, 'Receive thy sight; thy faith hath saved thee;'

**⁴³** and presently he did receive sight, and was following him, glorifying God; and all the people, having seen, did give praise to God.
