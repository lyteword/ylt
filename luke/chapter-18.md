# Chapter 18

<sup>1</sup> And he spake also a simile to them, that it behoveth [us] always to pray, and not to faint,

<sup>2</sup> saying, 'A certain judge was in a certain city — God he is not fearing, and man he is not regarding —

<sup>3</sup> and a widow was in that city, and she was coming unto him, saying, Do me justice on my opponent,

<sup>4</sup> and he would not for a time, but after these things he said in himself, Even if God I do not fear, and man do not regard,

<sup>5</sup> yet because this widow doth give me trouble, I will do her justice, lest, perpetually coming, she may plague me.'

<sup>6</sup> And the Lord said, 'Hear ye what the unrighteous judge saith:

<sup>7</sup> and shall not God execute the justice to His choice ones, who are crying unto Him day and night — bearing long in regard to them?

<sup>8</sup> I say to you, that He will execute the justice to them quickly; but the Son of Man having come, shall he find the faith upon the earth?'

<sup>9</sup> And he spake also unto certain who have been trusting in themselves that they were righteous, and have been despising the rest, this simile:

<sup>10</sup> 'Two men went up to the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax-gatherer;

<sup>11</sup> the Pharisee having stood by himself, thus prayed: God, I thank Thee that I am not as the rest of men, rapacious, unrighteous, adulterers, or even as this tax-gatherer;

<sup>12</sup> I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all things — as many as I possess.

<sup>13</sup> 'And the tax-gatherer, having stood afar off, would not even the eyes lift up to the heaven, but was smiting on his breast, saying, God be propitious to me — the sinner!

<sup>14</sup> I say to you, this one went down declared righteous, to his house, rather than that one: for every one who is exalting himself shall be humbled, and he who is humbling himself shall be exalted.'

<sup>15</sup> And they were bringing near also the babes, that he may touch them, and the disciples having seen did rebuke them,

<sup>16</sup> and Jesus having called them near, said, 'Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the reign of God;

<sup>17</sup> verily I say to you, Whoever may not receive the reign of God as a little child, may not enter into it.'

<sup>18</sup> And a certain ruler questioned him, saying, 'Good teacher, what having done — shall I inherit life age-during?'

<sup>19</sup> And Jesus said to him, 'Why me dost thou call good? no one [is] good, except One — God;

<sup>20</sup> the commands thou hast known: Thou mayest not commit adultery, Thou mayest do no murder, Thou mayest not steal, Thou mayest not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.'

<sup>21</sup> And he said, 'All these I did keep from my youth;'

<sup>22</sup> and having heard these things, Jesus said to him, 'Yet one thing to thee is lacking; all things — as many as thou hast — sell, and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come, be following me;'

<sup>23</sup> and he, having heard these things, became very sorrowful, for he was exceeding rich.

<sup>24</sup> And Jesus having seen him become very sorrowful, said, 'How hardly shall those having riches enter into the reign of God!

<sup>25</sup> for it is easier for a camel through the eye of a needle to enter, than for a rich man into the reign of God to enter.'

<sup>26</sup> And those who heard, said, 'And who is able to be saved?'

<sup>27</sup> and he said, 'The things impossible with men are possible with God.'

<sup>28</sup> And Peter said, 'Lo, we left all, and did follow thee;'

<sup>29</sup> and he said to them, 'Verily I say to you, that there is not one who left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, for the sake of the reign of God,

<sup>30</sup> who may not receive back manifold more in this time, and in the coming age, life age-during.'

<sup>31</sup> And having taken the twelve aside, he said unto them, 'Lo, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things shall be completed — that have been written through the prophets — to the Son of Man,

<sup>32</sup> for he shall be delivered up to the nations, and shall be mocked, and insulted, and spit upon,

<sup>33</sup> and having scourged they shall put him to death, and on the third day he shall rise again.'

<sup>34</sup> And they none of these things understood, and this saying was hid from them, and they were not knowing the things said.

<sup>35</sup> And it came to pass, in his coming nigh to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting beside the way begging,

<sup>36</sup> and having heard a multitude going by, he was inquiring what this may be,

<sup>37</sup> and they brought him word that Jesus the Nazarene doth pass by,

<sup>38</sup> and he cried out, saying, 'Jesus, Son of David, deal kindly with me;'

<sup>39</sup> and those going before were rebuking him, that he might be silent, but he was much more crying out, 'Son of David, deal kindly with me.'

<sup>40</sup> And Jesus having stood, commanded him to be brought unto him, and he having come nigh, he questioned him,

<sup>41</sup> saying, 'What wilt thou I shall do to thee?' and he said, 'Sir, that I may receive sight.'

<sup>42</sup> And Jesus said to him, 'Receive thy sight; thy faith hath saved thee;'

<sup>43</sup> and presently he did receive sight, and was following him, glorifying God; and all the people, having seen, did give praise to God.
