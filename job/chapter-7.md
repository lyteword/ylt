# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> Is there not a warfare to man on earth? And as the days of an hireling his days?

<sup>2</sup> As a servant desireth the shadow, And as a hireling expecteth his wage,

<sup>3</sup> So I have been caused to inherit months of vanity, And nights of misery they numbered to me.

<sup>4</sup> If I lay down then I said, 'When do I rise!' And evening hath been measured, And I have been full of tossings till dawn.

<sup>5</sup> Clothed hath been my flesh [with] worms, And a clod of dust, My skin hath been shrivelled and is loathsome,

<sup>6</sup> My days swifter than a weaving machine, And they are consumed without hope.

<sup>7</sup> Remember Thou that my life [is] a breath, Mine eye turneth not back to see good.

<sup>8</sup> The eye of my beholder beholdeth me not. Thine eyes [are] upon me — and I am not.

<sup>9</sup> Consumed hath been a cloud, and it goeth, So he who is going down to Sheol cometh not up.

<sup>10</sup> He turneth not again to his house, Nor doth his place discern him again.

<sup>11</sup> Also I — I withhold not my mouth — I speak in the distress of my spirit, I talk in the bitterness of my soul.

<sup>12</sup> A sea -[monster] am I, or a dragon, That thou settest over me a guard?

<sup>13</sup> When I said, 'My bed doth comfort me,' He taketh away in my talking my couch.

<sup>14</sup> And thou hast affrighted me with dreams, And from visions thou terrifiest me,

<sup>15</sup> And my soul chooseth strangling, Death rather than my bones.

<sup>16</sup> I have wasted away — not to the age do I live. Cease from me, for my days [are] vanity.

<sup>17</sup> What [is] man that Thou dost magnify him? And that Thou settest unto him Thy heart?

<sup>18</sup> And inspectest him in the mornings, In the evenings dost try him?

<sup>19</sup> How long dost Thou not look from me? Thou dost not desist till I swallow my spittle.

<sup>20</sup> I have sinned, what do I to Thee, O watcher of man? Why hast Thou set me for a mark to Thee, And I am for a burden to myself — and what?

<sup>21</sup> Thou dost not take away my transgression, And cause to pass away mine iniquity, Because now, for dust I lie down: And Thou hast sought me — and I am not!
