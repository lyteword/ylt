# Chapter 39

<sup>1</sup> Hast thou known the time of The bearing of the wild goats of the rock? The bringing forth of hinds thou dost mark!

<sup>2</sup> Thou dost number the months they fulfil? And thou hast known the time of their bringing forth!

<sup>3</sup> They bow down, Their young ones they bring forth safely, Their pangs they cast forth.

<sup>4</sup> Safe are their young ones, They grow up in the field, they have gone out, And have not returned to them.

<sup>5</sup> Who hath sent forth the wild ass free? Yea, the bands of the wild ass who opened?

<sup>6</sup> Whose house I have made the wilderness, And his dwellings the barren land,

<sup>7</sup> He doth laugh at the multitude of a city, The cries of an exactor he heareth not.

<sup>8</sup> The range of mountains [is] his pasture, And after every green thing he seeketh.

<sup>9</sup> Is a Reem willing to serve thee? Doth he lodge by thy crib?

<sup>10</sup> Dost thou bind a Reem in a furrow [with] his thick band? Doth he harrow valleys after thee?

<sup>11</sup> Dost thou trust in him because great [is] his power? And dost thou leave unto him thy labour?

<sup>12</sup> Dost thou trust in him That he doth bring back thy seed? And [to] thy threshing-floor doth gather [it]?

<sup>13</sup> The wing of the rattling ones exulteth, Whether the pinion of the ostrich or hawk.

<sup>14</sup> For she leaveth on the earth her eggs, And on the dust she doth warm them,

<sup>15</sup> And she forgetteth that a foot may press it, And a beast of the field tread it down.

<sup>16</sup> Her young ones it hath hardened without her, In vain [is] her labour without fear.

<sup>17</sup> For God hath caused her to forget wisdom, And He hath not given a portion To her in understanding:

<sup>18</sup> At the time on high she lifteth herself up, She laugheth at the horse and at his rider.

<sup>19</sup> Dost thou give to the horse might? Dost thou clothe his neck [with] a mane?

<sup>20</sup> Dost thou cause him to rush as a locust? The majesty of his snorting [is] terrible.

<sup>21</sup> They dig in a valley, and he rejoiceth in power, He goeth forth to meet the armour.

<sup>22</sup> He laugheth at fear, and is not affrighted, And he turneth not back from the face of the sword.

<sup>23</sup> Against him rattle doth quiver, The flame of a spear, and a halbert.

<sup>24</sup> With trembling and rage he swalloweth the ground, And remaineth not stedfast Because of the sound of a trumpet.

<sup>25</sup> Among the trumpets he saith, Aha, And from afar he doth smell battle, Roaring of princes and shouting.

<sup>26</sup> By thine understanding flieth a hawk? Spreadeth he his wings to the south?

<sup>27</sup> At thy command goeth an eagle up high? Or lifteth he up his nest?

<sup>28</sup> A rock he doth inhabit, Yea, he lodgeth on the tooth of a rock, and fortress.

<sup>29</sup> From thence he hath sought food, To a far off place his eyes look attentively,

<sup>30</sup> And his brood gulp up blood, And where the pierced [are] — there [is] he!
