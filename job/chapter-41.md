# Chapter 41

<sup>1</sup> Dost thou draw leviathan with an angle? And with a rope thou lettest down — his tongue?

<sup>2</sup> Dost thou put a reed in his nose? And with a thorn pierce his jaw?

<sup>3</sup> Doth he multiply unto thee supplications? Doth he speak unto thee tender things?

<sup>4</sup> Doth he make a covenant with thee? Dost thou take him for a servant age-during?

<sup>5</sup> Dost thou play with him as a bird? And dost thou bind him for thy damsels?

<sup>6</sup> (Feast upon him do companions, They divide him among the merchants!)

<sup>7</sup> Dost thou fill with barbed irons his skin? And with fish-spears his head?

<sup>8</sup> Place on him thy hand, Remember the battle — do not add!

<sup>9</sup> Lo, the hope of him is found a liar, Also at his appearance is not one cast down?

<sup>10</sup> None so fierce that he doth awake him, And who [is] he before Me stationeth himself?

<sup>11</sup> Who hath brought before Me and I repay? Under the whole heavens it [is] mine.

<sup>12</sup> I do not keep silent concerning his parts, And the matter of might, And the grace of his arrangement.

<sup>13</sup> Who hath uncovered the face of his clothing? Within his double bridle who doth enter?

<sup>14</sup> The doors of his face who hath opened? Round about his teeth [are] terrible.

<sup>15</sup> A pride — strong ones of shields, Shut up — a close seal.

<sup>16</sup> One unto another they draw nigh, And air doth not enter between them.

<sup>17</sup> One unto another they adhere, They stick together and are not separated.

<sup>18</sup> His sneezings cause light to shine, And his eyes [are] as the eyelids of the dawn.

<sup>19</sup> Out of his mouth do flames go, sparks of fire escape.

<sup>20</sup> Out of his nostrils goeth forth smoke, As a blown pot and reeds.

<sup>21</sup> His breath setteth coals on fire, And a flame from his mouth goeth forth.

<sup>22</sup> In his neck lodge doth strength, And before him doth grief exult.

<sup>23</sup> The flakes of his flesh have adhered — Firm upon him — it is not moved.

<sup>24</sup> His heart [is] firm as a stone, Yea, firm as the lower piece.

<sup>25</sup> From his rising are the mighty afraid, From breakings they keep themselves free.

<sup>26</sup> The sword of his overtaker standeth not, Spear — dart — and lance.

<sup>27</sup> He reckoneth iron as straw, brass as rotten wood.

<sup>28</sup> The son of the bow doth not cause him to flee, Turned by him into stubble are stones of the sling.

<sup>29</sup> As stubble have darts been reckoned, And he laugheth at the shaking of a javelin.

<sup>30</sup> Under him [are] sharp points of clay, He spreadeth gold on the mire.

<sup>31</sup> He causeth to boil as a pot the deep, The sea he maketh as a pot of ointment.

<sup>32</sup> After him he causeth a path to shine, One thinketh the deep to be hoary.

<sup>33</sup> There is not on the earth his like, That is made without terror.

<sup>34</sup> Every high thing he doth see, He [is] king over all sons of pride.
