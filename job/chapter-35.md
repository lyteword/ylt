# Chapter 35

<sup>1</sup> And Elihu answereth and saith: —

<sup>2</sup> This hast thou reckoned for judgment: Thou hast said — 'My righteousness [is] more than God's?'

<sup>3</sup> For thou sayest, 'What doth it profit Thee! What do I profit from my sin?'

<sup>4</sup> I return thee words, and thy friends with thee,

<sup>5</sup> Behold attentively the heavens — and see, And behold the clouds, They have been higher than thou.

<sup>6</sup> If thou hast sinned, what dost thou against Him? And thy transgressions have been multiplied, What dost thou to Him?

<sup>7</sup> If thou hast been righteous, What dost thou give to Him? Or what from thy hand doth He receive?

<sup>8</sup> For a man like thyself [is] thy wickedness, And for a son of man thy righteousness.

<sup>9</sup> Because of the multitude of oppressions They cause to cry out, They cry because of the arm of the mighty.

<sup>10</sup> And none said, 'Where [is] God my maker? Giving songs in the night,

<sup>11</sup> Teaching us more than the beasts of the earth, Yea, than the fowl of the heavens He maketh us wiser.'

<sup>12</sup> There they cry, and He doth not answer, Because of the pride of evil doers.

<sup>13</sup> Surely vanity God doth not hear, And the Mighty doth not behold it.

<sup>14</sup> Yea, though thou sayest thou dost not behold Him, Judgment [is] before Him, and stay for Him.

<sup>15</sup> And, now, because there is not, He hath appointed His anger, And He hath not known in great extremity.

<sup>16</sup> And Job [with] vanity doth open his mouth, Without knowledge words he multiplieth.
