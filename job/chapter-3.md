# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> After this hath Job opened his mouth, and revileth his day.

<sup>2</sup> And Job answereth and saith: —

<sup>3</sup> Let the day perish in which I am born, And the night that hath said: 'A man-child hath been conceived.'

<sup>4</sup> That day — let it be darkness, Let not God require it from above, Nor let light shine upon it.

<sup>5</sup> Let darkness and death-shade redeem it, Let a cloud tabernacle upon it, Let them terrify it as the most bitter of days.

<sup>6</sup> That night — let thick darkness take it, Let it not be united to days of the year, Into the number of months let it not come.

<sup>7</sup> Lo! that night — let it be gloomy, Let no singing come into it.

<sup>8</sup> Let the cursers of day mark it, Who are ready to wake up Leviathan.

<sup>9</sup> Let the stars of its twilight be dark, Let it wait for light, and there is none, And let it not look on the eyelids of the dawn.

<sup>10</sup> Because it hath not shut the doors Of the womb that was mine! And hide misery from mine eyes.

<sup>11</sup> Why from the womb do I not die? From the belly I have come forth and gasp!

<sup>12</sup> Wherefore have knees been before me? And what [are] breasts, that I suck?

<sup>13</sup> For now, I have lain down, and am quiet, I have slept — then there is rest to me,

<sup>14</sup> With kings and counsellors of earth, These building wastes for themselves.

<sup>15</sup> Or with princes — they have gold, They are filling their houses [with] silver.

<sup>16</sup> (Or as a hidden abortion I am not, As infants — they have not seen light.)

<sup>17</sup> There the wicked have ceased troubling, And there rest do the wearied in power.

<sup>18</sup> Together prisoners have been at ease, They have not heard the voice of an exactor,

<sup>19</sup> Small and great [are] there the same. And a servant [is] free from his lord.

<sup>20</sup> Why giveth He to the miserable light, and life to the bitter soul?

<sup>21</sup> Who are waiting for death, and it is not, And they seek it above hid treasures.

<sup>22</sup> Who are glad — unto joy, They rejoice when they find a grave.

<sup>23</sup> To a man whose way hath been hidden, And whom God doth shut up?

<sup>24</sup> For before my food, my sighing cometh, And poured out as waters [are] my roarings.

<sup>25</sup> For a fear I feared and it meeteth me, And what I was afraid of doth come to me.

<sup>26</sup> I was not safe — nor was I quiet — Nor was I at rest — and trouble cometh!
