# Job 26 

**¹** And Job answereth and saith: —

**²** What — thou hast helped the powerless, Saved an arm not strong!

**³** What — thou hast given counsel to the unwise, And wise plans in abundance made known.

**⁴** With whom hast thou declared words? And whose breath came forth from thee?

**⁵** The Rephaim are formed, Beneath the waters, also their inhabitants.

**⁶** Naked [is] Sheol over-against Him, And there is no covering to destruction.

**⁷** Stretching out the north over desolation, Hanging the earth upon nothing,

**⁸** Binding up the waters in His thick clouds, And the cloud is not rent under them.

**⁹** Taking hold of the face of the throne, Spreading over it His cloud.

**¹⁰** A limit He hath placed on the waters, Unto the boundary of light with darkness.

**¹¹** Pillars of the heavens do tremble, And they wonder because of His rebuke.

**¹²** By His power He hath quieted the sea, And by His understanding smitten the proud.

**¹³** By His Spirit the heavens He beautified, Formed hath His hand the fleeing serpent.

**¹⁴** Lo, these [are] the borders of His way, And how little a matter is heard of Him, And the thunder of His might Who doth understand?
