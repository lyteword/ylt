# Chapter 26

<sup>1</sup> And Job answereth and saith: —

<sup>2</sup> What — thou hast helped the powerless, Saved an arm not strong!

<sup>3</sup> What — thou hast given counsel to the unwise, And wise plans in abundance made known.

<sup>4</sup> With whom hast thou declared words? And whose breath came forth from thee?

<sup>5</sup> The Rephaim are formed, Beneath the waters, also their inhabitants.

<sup>6</sup> Naked [is] Sheol over-against Him, And there is no covering to destruction.

<sup>7</sup> Stretching out the north over desolation, Hanging the earth upon nothing,

<sup>8</sup> Binding up the waters in His thick clouds, And the cloud is not rent under them.

<sup>9</sup> Taking hold of the face of the throne, Spreading over it His cloud.

<sup>10</sup> A limit He hath placed on the waters, Unto the boundary of light with darkness.

<sup>11</sup> Pillars of the heavens do tremble, And they wonder because of His rebuke.

<sup>12</sup> By His power He hath quieted the sea, And by His understanding smitten the proud.

<sup>13</sup> By His Spirit the heavens He beautified, Formed hath His hand the fleeing serpent.

<sup>14</sup> Lo, these [are] the borders of His way, And how little a matter is heard of Him, And the thunder of His might Who doth understand?
