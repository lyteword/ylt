# Job 25 

**¹** And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith: —

**²** The rule and fear [are] with Him, Making peace in His high places.

**³** Is their [any] number to His troops? And on whom ariseth not His light?

**⁴** And what? is man righteous with God? And what? is he pure — born of a woman?

**⁵** Lo — unto the moon, and it shineth not, And stars have not been pure in His eyes.

**⁶** How much less man — a grub, And the son of man — a worm!
