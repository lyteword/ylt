# Chapter 25

<sup>1</sup> And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith: —

<sup>2</sup> The rule and fear [are] with Him, Making peace in His high places.

<sup>3</sup> Is their [any] number to His troops? And on whom ariseth not His light?

<sup>4</sup> And what? is man righteous with God? And what? is he pure — born of a woman?

<sup>5</sup> Lo — unto the moon, and it shineth not, And stars have not been pure in His eyes.

<sup>6</sup> How much less man — a grub, And the son of man — a worm!
