# Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith: —

<sup>2</sup> Till when dost thou speak these things? And a strong wind — sayings of thy mouth?

<sup>3</sup> Doth God pervert judgment? And doth the Mighty One pervert justice?

<sup>4</sup> If thy sons have sinned before Him, And He doth send them away, By the hand of their transgression,

<sup>5</sup> If thou dost seek early unto God, And unto the Mighty makest supplication,

<sup>6</sup> If pure and upright thou [art], Surely now He waketh for thee, And hath completed The habitation of thy righteousness.

<sup>7</sup> And thy beginning hath been small, And thy latter end is very great.

<sup>8</sup> For, ask I pray thee of a former generation, And prepare to a search of their fathers,

<sup>9</sup> (For of yesterday we [are], and we know not, For a shadow [are] our days on earth.)

<sup>10</sup> Do they not shew thee — speak to thee, And from their heart bring forth words?

<sup>11</sup> 'Doth a rush wise without mire? A reed increase without water?

<sup>12</sup> While it [is] in its budding — uncropped, Even before any herb it withereth.

<sup>13</sup> So [are] the paths of all forgetting God, And the hope of the profane doth perish,

<sup>14</sup> Whose confidence is loathsome, And the house of a spider his trust.

<sup>15</sup> He leaneth on his house — and it standeth not: He taketh hold on it — and it abideth not.

<sup>16</sup> Green he [is] before the sun, And over his garden his branch goeth out.

<sup>17</sup> By a heap his roots are wrapped, A house of stones he looketh for.

<sup>18</sup> If [one] doth destroy him from his place, Then it hath feigned concerning him, I have not seen thee!

<sup>19</sup> Lo, this [is] the joy of his way, And from the dust others spring up.'

<sup>20</sup> Lo, God doth not reject the perfect, Nor taketh hold on the hand of evil doers.

<sup>21</sup> While he filleth with laughter thy mouth, And thy lips with shouting,

<sup>22</sup> Those hating thee do put on shame, And the tent of the wicked is not!
