# Job 8 

**¹** And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith: —

**²** Till when dost thou speak these things? And a strong wind — sayings of thy mouth?

**³** Doth God pervert judgment? And doth the Mighty One pervert justice?

**⁴** If thy sons have sinned before Him, And He doth send them away, By the hand of their transgression,

**⁵** If thou dost seek early unto God, And unto the Mighty makest supplication,

**⁶** If pure and upright thou [art], Surely now He waketh for thee, And hath completed The habitation of thy righteousness.

**⁷** And thy beginning hath been small, And thy latter end is very great.

**⁸** For, ask I pray thee of a former generation, And prepare to a search of their fathers,

**⁹** (For of yesterday we [are], and we know not, For a shadow [are] our days on earth.)

**¹⁰** Do they not shew thee — speak to thee, And from their heart bring forth words?

**¹¹** 'Doth a rush wise without mire? A reed increase without water?

**¹²** While it [is] in its budding — uncropped, Even before any herb it withereth.

**¹³** So [are] the paths of all forgetting God, And the hope of the profane doth perish,

**¹⁴** Whose confidence is loathsome, And the house of a spider his trust.

**¹⁵** He leaneth on his house — and it standeth not: He taketh hold on it — and it abideth not.

**¹⁶** Green he [is] before the sun, And over his garden his branch goeth out.

**¹⁷** By a heap his roots are wrapped, A house of stones he looketh for.

**¹⁸** If [one] doth destroy him from his place, Then it hath feigned concerning him, I have not seen thee!

**¹⁹** Lo, this [is] the joy of his way, And from the dust others spring up.'

**²⁰** Lo, God doth not reject the perfect, Nor taketh hold on the hand of evil doers.

**²¹** While he filleth with laughter thy mouth, And thy lips with shouting,

**²²** Those hating thee do put on shame, And the tent of the wicked is not!
