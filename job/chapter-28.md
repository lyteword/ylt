# Chapter 28

<sup>1</sup> Surely there is for silver a source, And a place for the gold they refine;

<sup>2</sup> Iron from the dust is taken, And [from] the firm stone brass.

<sup>3</sup> An end hath he set to darkness, And to all perfection he is searching, A stone of darkness and death-shade.

<sup>4</sup> A stream hath broken out from a sojourner, Those forgotten of the foot, They were low, from man they wandered.

<sup>5</sup> The earth! from it cometh forth bread, And its under-part is turned like fire.

<sup>6</sup> A place of the sapphire [are] its stones, And it hath dust of gold.

<sup>7</sup> A path — not known it hath a ravenous fowl, Nor scorched it hath an eye of the kite,

<sup>8</sup> Nor trodden it have the sons of pride, Not passed over it hath the fierce lion.

<sup>9</sup> Against the flint he sent forth his hand, He overturned from the root mountains.

<sup>10</sup> Among rocks, brooks he hath cleaved, And every precious thing hath his eye seen.

<sup>11</sup> From overflowing floods he hath bound, And the hidden thing bringeth out [to] light.

<sup>12</sup> And the wisdom — whence is it found? And where [is] this, the place of understanding?

<sup>13</sup> Man hath not known its arrangement, Nor is it found in the land of the living.

<sup>14</sup> The deep hath said, 'It [is] not in me,' And the sea hath said, 'It is not with me.'

<sup>15</sup> Gold is not given for it, Nor is silver weighed — its price.

<sup>16</sup> It is not valued with pure gold of Ophir, With precious onyx and sapphire,

<sup>17</sup> Not equal it do gold and crystal, Nor [is] its exchange a vessel of fine gold.

<sup>18</sup> Corals and pearl are not remembered, The acquisition of wisdom [is] above rubies.

<sup>19</sup> Not equal it doth the topaz of Cush, With pure gold it is not valued.

<sup>20</sup> And the wisdom — whence doth it come? And where [is] this, the place of understanding?

<sup>21</sup> It hath been hid from the eyes of all living. And from the fowl of the heavens It hath been hidden.

<sup>22</sup> Destruction and death have said: 'With our ears we have heard its fame.'

<sup>23</sup> God hath understood its way, And He hath known its place.

<sup>24</sup> For He to the ends of the earth doth look, Under the whole heavens He doth see,

<sup>25</sup> To make for the wind a weight, And the waters He meted out in measure.

<sup>26</sup> In His making for the rain a limit, And a way for the brightness of the voices,

<sup>27</sup> Then He hath seen and declareth it, He hath prepared it, and also searched it out,

<sup>28</sup> And He saith to man: — 'Lo, fear of the Lord, that [is] wisdom, And to turn from evil [is] understanding.'
