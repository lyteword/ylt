# Chapter 22

<sup>1</sup> And Eliphaz the Temanite answereth and saith: —

<sup>2</sup> To God is a man profitable, Because a wise man to himself is profitable?

<sup>3</sup> Is it a delight to the Mighty One That thou art righteous? is it gain, That thou makest perfect thy ways?

<sup>4</sup> Because of thy reverence Doth He reason [with] thee? He entereth with thee into judgment:

<sup>5</sup> Is not thy wickedness abundant? And there is no end to thine iniquities.

<sup>6</sup> For thou takest a pledge of thy brother for nought, And the garments of the naked Thou dost strip off.

<sup>7</sup> Thou causest not the weary to drink water, And from the hungry thou withholdest bread.

<sup>8</sup> As to the man of arm — he hath the earth, And the accepted of face — he dwelleth in it.

<sup>9</sup> Widows thou hast sent away empty, And the arms of the fatherless are bruised.

<sup>10</sup> Therefore round about thee [are] snares, And trouble thee doth fear suddenly.

<sup>11</sup> Or darkness — thou dost not see, And abundance of waters doth cover thee.

<sup>12</sup> Is not God high [in] heaven? And see the summit of the stars, That they are high.

<sup>13</sup> And thou hast said, 'What — hath God known? Through thickness doth He judge?

<sup>14</sup> Thick clouds [are] a secret place to Him, And He doth not see;' And the circle of the heavens He walketh habitually,

<sup>15</sup> The path of the age dost thou observe, That men of iniquity have trodden?

<sup>16</sup> Who have been cut down unexpectedly, A flood is poured out on their foundation.

<sup>17</sup> Those saying to God, 'Turn aside from us,' And what doth the Mighty One to them?

<sup>18</sup> And he hath filled their houses [with] good: (And the counsel of the wicked Hath been far from me.)

<sup>19</sup> See do the righteous and they rejoice, And the innocent mocketh at them,

<sup>20</sup> 'Surely our substance hath not been cut off, And their excellency hath fire consumed.'

<sup>21</sup> Acquaint thyself, I pray thee, with Him, And be at peace, Thereby thine increase [is] good.

<sup>22</sup> Receive, I pray thee, from His mouth a law, And set His sayings in thy heart.

<sup>23</sup> If thou dost return unto the Mighty Thou art built up, Thou puttest iniquity far from thy tents.

<sup>24</sup> So as to set on the dust a defence, And on a rock of the valleys a covering.

<sup>25</sup> And the Mighty hath been thy defence, And silver [is] strength to thee.

<sup>26</sup> For then on the Mighty thou delightest thyself, And dost lift up unto God thy face,

<sup>27</sup> Thou dost make supplication unto Him, And He doth hear thee, And thy vows thou completest.

<sup>28</sup> And thou decreest a saying, And it is established to thee, And on thy ways hath light shone.

<sup>29</sup> For they have made low, And thou sayest, 'Lift up.' And the bowed down of eyes he saveth.

<sup>30</sup> He delivereth the not innocent, Yea, he hath been delivered By the cleanness of thy hands.
