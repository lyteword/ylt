# Chapter 17

**¹** My spirit hath been destroyed, My days extinguished — graves [are] for me.

**²** If not — mockeries [are] with me. And in their provocations mine eye lodgeth.

**³** Place, I pray Thee, my pledge with Thee; Who is he that striketh hand with me?

**⁴** For their heart Thou hast hidden From understanding, Therefore Thou dost not exalt them.

**⁵** For a portion he sheweth friendship, And the eyes of his sons are consumed.

**⁶** And he set me up for a proverb of the peoples, And a wonder before them I am.

**⁷** And dim from sorrow is mine eye, And my members as a shadow all of them.

**⁸** Astonished are the upright at this, And the innocent against the profane Stirreth himself up.

**⁹** And the righteous layeth hold [on] his way, And the clean of hands addeth strength, And — dumb are they all.

**¹⁰** Return, and come in, I pray you, And I find not among you a wise man.

**¹¹** My days have passed by, My devices have been broken off, The possessions of my heart!

**¹²** Night for day they appoint, Light [is] near because of darkness.

**¹³** If I wait — Sheol [is] my house, In darkness I have spread out my couch.

**¹⁴** To corruption I have called: — 'Thou [art] my father.' 'My mother' and 'my sister' — to the worm.

**¹⁵** And where [is] now my hope? Yea, my hope, who doth behold it?

**¹⁶** [To] the parts of Sheol ye go down, If together on the dust we may rest.
