# Chapter 17

<sup>1</sup> My spirit hath been destroyed, My days extinguished — graves [are] for me.

<sup>2</sup> If not — mockeries [are] with me. And in their provocations mine eye lodgeth.

<sup>3</sup> Place, I pray Thee, my pledge with Thee; Who is he that striketh hand with me?

<sup>4</sup> For their heart Thou hast hidden From understanding, Therefore Thou dost not exalt them.

<sup>5</sup> For a portion he sheweth friendship, And the eyes of his sons are consumed.

<sup>6</sup> And he set me up for a proverb of the peoples, And a wonder before them I am.

<sup>7</sup> And dim from sorrow is mine eye, And my members as a shadow all of them.

<sup>8</sup> Astonished are the upright at this, And the innocent against the profane Stirreth himself up.

<sup>9</sup> And the righteous layeth hold [on] his way, And the clean of hands addeth strength, And — dumb are they all.

<sup>10</sup> Return, and come in, I pray you, And I find not among you a wise man.

<sup>11</sup> My days have passed by, My devices have been broken off, The possessions of my heart!

<sup>12</sup> Night for day they appoint, Light [is] near because of darkness.

<sup>13</sup> If I wait — Sheol [is] my house, In darkness I have spread out my couch.

<sup>14</sup> To corruption I have called: — 'Thou [art] my father.' 'My mother' and 'my sister' — to the worm.

<sup>15</sup> And where [is] now my hope? Yea, my hope, who doth behold it?

<sup>16</sup> [To] the parts of Sheol ye go down, If together on the dust we may rest.
