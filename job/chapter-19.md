# Chapter 19

<sup>1</sup> And Job answereth and saith: —

<sup>2</sup> Till when do ye afflict my soul, And bruise me with words?

<sup>3</sup> These ten times ye put me to shame, ye blush not. Ye make yourselves strange to me —

<sup>4</sup> And also — truly, I have erred, With me doth my error remain.

<sup>5</sup> If, truly, over me ye magnify yourselves, And decide against me my reproach;

<sup>6</sup> Know now, that God turned me upside down, And His net against me hath set round,

<sup>7</sup> Lo, I cry out — violence, and am not answered, I cry aloud, and there is no judgment.

<sup>8</sup> My way He hedged up, and I pass not over, And on my paths darkness He placeth.

<sup>9</sup> Mine honour from off me He hath stripped, And He turneth the crown from my head.

<sup>10</sup> He breaketh me down round about, and I go, And removeth like a tree my hope.

<sup>11</sup> And He kindleth against me His anger, And reckoneth me to Him as His adversaries.

<sup>12</sup> Come in do His troops together, And they raise up against me their way, And encamp round about my tent.

<sup>13</sup> My brethren from me He hath put far off, And mine acquaintances surely Have been estranged from me.

<sup>14</sup> Ceased have my neighbours And my familiar friends have forgotten me,

<sup>15</sup> Sojourners of my house and my maids, For a stranger reckon me: An alien I have been in their eyes.

<sup>16</sup> To my servant I have called, And he doth not answer, With my mouth I make supplication to him.

<sup>17</sup> My spirit is strange to my wife, And my favours to the sons of my [mother's] womb.

<sup>18</sup> Also sucklings have despised me, I rise, and they speak against me.

<sup>19</sup> Abominate me do all the men of my counsel, And those I have loved, Have been turned against me.

<sup>20</sup> To my skin and to my flesh Cleaved hath my bone, And I deliver myself with the skin of my teeth.

<sup>21</sup> Pity me, pity me, ye my friends, For the hand of God hath stricken against me.

<sup>22</sup> Why do you pursue me as God? And with my flesh are not satisfied?

<sup>23</sup> Who doth grant now, That my words may be written? Who doth grant that in a book they may be graven?

<sup>24</sup> With a pen of iron and lead — For ever in a rock they may be hewn.

<sup>25</sup> That — I have known my Redeemer, The Living and the Last, For the dust he doth rise.

<sup>26</sup> And after my skin hath compassed this [body], Then from my flesh I see God:

<sup>27</sup> Whom I — I see on my side, And mine eyes have beheld, and not a stranger, Consumed have been my reins in my bosom.

<sup>28</sup> But ye say, 'Why do we pursue after him?' And the root of the matter hath been found in me.

<sup>29</sup> Be ye afraid because of the sword, For furious [are] the punishments of the sword, That ye may know that [there is] a judgment.
