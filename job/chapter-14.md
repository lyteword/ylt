# Chapter 14

**¹** Man, born of woman! Of few days, and full of trouble!

**²** As a flower he hath gone forth, and is cut off, And he fleeth as a shadow and standeth not.

**³** Also — on this Thou hast opened Thine eyes, And dost bring me into judgment with Thee.

**⁴** Who giveth a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.

**⁵** If determined are his days, The number of his months [are] with Thee, His limit Thou hast made, And he passeth not over;

**⁶** Look away from off him that he may cease, Till he enjoy as an hireling his day.

**⁷** For there is of a tree hope, if it be cut down, That again it doth change, That its tender branch doth not cease.

**⁸** If its root becometh old in the earth, And its stem doth die in the dust,

**⁹** From the fragrance of water it doth flourish, And hath made a crop as a plant.

**¹⁰** And a man dieth, and becometh weak, And man expireth, and where [is] he?

**¹¹** Waters have gone away from a sea, And a river becometh waste and dry.

**¹²** And man hath lain down, and riseth not, Till the wearing out of the heavens they awake not, Nor are roused from their sleep.

**¹³** O that in Sheol Thou wouldest conceal me, Hide me till the turning of Thine anger, Set for me a limit, and remember me.

**¹⁴** If a man dieth — doth he revive? All days of my warfare I wait, till my change come.

**¹⁵** Thou dost call, and I — I answer Thee; To the work of Thy hands Thou hast desire.

**¹⁶** But now, my steps Thou numberest, Thou dost not watch over my sin.

**¹⁷** Sealed up in a bag [is] my transgression, And Thou sewest up mine iniquity.

**¹⁸** And yet, a falling mountain wasteth away, And a rock is removed from its place.

**¹⁹** Stones have waters worn away, Their outpourings wash away the dust of earth, And the hope of man Thou hast destroyed.

**²⁰** Thou prevailest [over] him for ever, and he goeth, He is changing his countenance, And Thou sendest him away.

**²¹** Honoured are his sons, and he knoweth not; And they are little, and he attendeth not to them.

**²²** Only — his flesh for him is pained, And his soul for him doth mourn.'
