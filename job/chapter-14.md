# Chapter 14

<sup>1</sup> Man, born of woman! Of few days, and full of trouble!

<sup>2</sup> As a flower he hath gone forth, and is cut off, And he fleeth as a shadow and standeth not.

<sup>3</sup> Also — on this Thou hast opened Thine eyes, And dost bring me into judgment with Thee.

<sup>4</sup> Who giveth a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.

<sup>5</sup> If determined are his days, The number of his months [are] with Thee, His limit Thou hast made, And he passeth not over;

<sup>6</sup> Look away from off him that he may cease, Till he enjoy as an hireling his day.

<sup>7</sup> For there is of a tree hope, if it be cut down, That again it doth change, That its tender branch doth not cease.

<sup>8</sup> If its root becometh old in the earth, And its stem doth die in the dust,

<sup>9</sup> From the fragrance of water it doth flourish, And hath made a crop as a plant.

<sup>10</sup> And a man dieth, and becometh weak, And man expireth, and where [is] he?

<sup>11</sup> Waters have gone away from a sea, And a river becometh waste and dry.

<sup>12</sup> And man hath lain down, and riseth not, Till the wearing out of the heavens they awake not, Nor are roused from their sleep.

<sup>13</sup> O that in Sheol Thou wouldest conceal me, Hide me till the turning of Thine anger, Set for me a limit, and remember me.

<sup>14</sup> If a man dieth — doth he revive? All days of my warfare I wait, till my change come.

<sup>15</sup> Thou dost call, and I — I answer Thee; To the work of Thy hands Thou hast desire.

<sup>16</sup> But now, my steps Thou numberest, Thou dost not watch over my sin.

<sup>17</sup> Sealed up in a bag [is] my transgression, And Thou sewest up mine iniquity.

<sup>18</sup> And yet, a falling mountain wasteth away, And a rock is removed from its place.

<sup>19</sup> Stones have waters worn away, Their outpourings wash away the dust of earth, And the hope of man Thou hast destroyed.

<sup>20</sup> Thou prevailest [over] him for ever, and he goeth, He is changing his countenance, And Thou sendest him away.

<sup>21</sup> Honoured are his sons, and he knoweth not; And they are little, and he attendeth not to them.

<sup>22</sup> Only — his flesh for him is pained, And his soul for him doth mourn.'
