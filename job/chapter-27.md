# Job 27 

**¹** And Job addeth to lift up his simile, and saith: —

**²** God liveth! He turned aside my judgment, And the Mighty — He made my soul bitter.

**³** For all the while my breath [is] in me, And the spirit of God in my nostrils.

**⁴** My lips do not speak perverseness, And my tongue doth not utter deceit.

**⁵** Pollution to me — if I justify you, Till I expire I turn not aside mine integrity from me.

**⁶** On my righteousness I have laid hold, And I do not let it go, My heart doth not reproach me while I live.

**⁷** As the wicked is my enemy, And my withstander as the perverse.

**⁸** For what [is] the hope of the profane, When He doth cut off? When God doth cast off his soul?

**⁹** His cry doth God hear, When distress cometh on him?

**¹⁰** On the Mighty doth he delight himself? Call God at all times?

**¹¹** I shew you by the hand of God, That which [is] with the Mighty I hide not.

**¹²** Lo, ye — all of you — have seen, And why [is] this — ye are altogether vain?

**¹³** This [is] the portion of wicked man with God, And the inheritance of terrible ones From the Mighty they receive.

**¹⁴** If his sons multiply — for them [is] a sword. And his offspring [are] not satisfied [with] bread.

**¹⁵** His remnant in death are buried, And his widows do not weep.

**¹⁶** If he heap up as dust silver, And as clay prepare clothing,

**¹⁷** He prepareth — and the righteous putteth [it] on, And the silver the innocent doth apportion.

**¹⁸** He hath built as a moth his house, And as a booth a watchman hath made.

**¹⁹** Rich he lieth down, and he is not gathered, His eyes he hath opened, and he is not.

**²⁰** Overtake him as waters do terrors, By night stolen him away hath a whirlwind.

**²¹** Take him up doth an east wind, and he goeth, And it frighteneth him from his place,

**²²** And it casteth at him, and doth not spare, From its hand he diligently fleeth.

**²³** It clappeth at him its hands, And it hisseth at him from his place.
