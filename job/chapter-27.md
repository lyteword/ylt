# Chapter 27

<sup>1</sup> And Job addeth to lift up his simile, and saith: —

<sup>2</sup> God liveth! He turned aside my judgment, And the Mighty — He made my soul bitter.

<sup>3</sup> For all the while my breath [is] in me, And the spirit of God in my nostrils.

<sup>4</sup> My lips do not speak perverseness, And my tongue doth not utter deceit.

<sup>5</sup> Pollution to me — if I justify you, Till I expire I turn not aside mine integrity from me.

<sup>6</sup> On my righteousness I have laid hold, And I do not let it go, My heart doth not reproach me while I live.

<sup>7</sup> As the wicked is my enemy, And my withstander as the perverse.

<sup>8</sup> For what [is] the hope of the profane, When He doth cut off? When God doth cast off his soul?

<sup>9</sup> His cry doth God hear, When distress cometh on him?

<sup>10</sup> On the Mighty doth he delight himself? Call God at all times?

<sup>11</sup> I shew you by the hand of God, That which [is] with the Mighty I hide not.

<sup>12</sup> Lo, ye — all of you — have seen, And why [is] this — ye are altogether vain?

<sup>13</sup> This [is] the portion of wicked man with God, And the inheritance of terrible ones From the Mighty they receive.

<sup>14</sup> If his sons multiply — for them [is] a sword. And his offspring [are] not satisfied [with] bread.

<sup>15</sup> His remnant in death are buried, And his widows do not weep.

<sup>16</sup> If he heap up as dust silver, And as clay prepare clothing,

<sup>17</sup> He prepareth — and the righteous putteth [it] on, And the silver the innocent doth apportion.

<sup>18</sup> He hath built as a moth his house, And as a booth a watchman hath made.

<sup>19</sup> Rich he lieth down, and he is not gathered, His eyes he hath opened, and he is not.

<sup>20</sup> Overtake him as waters do terrors, By night stolen him away hath a whirlwind.

<sup>21</sup> Take him up doth an east wind, and he goeth, And it frighteneth him from his place,

<sup>22</sup> And it casteth at him, and doth not spare, From its hand he diligently fleeth.

<sup>23</sup> It clappeth at him its hands, And it hisseth at him from his place.
