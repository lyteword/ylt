# Chapter 36

<sup>1</sup> And Elihu addeth and saith: —

<sup>2</sup> Honour me a little, and I shew thee, That yet for God [are] words.

<sup>3</sup> I lift up my knowledge from afar, And to my Maker I ascribe righteousness.

<sup>4</sup> For, truly, my words [are] not false, The perfect in knowledge [is] with thee.

<sup>5</sup> Lo, God [is] mighty, and despiseth not, Mighty [in] power [and] heart.

<sup>6</sup> He reviveth not the wicked, And the judgment of the poor appointeth;

<sup>7</sup> He withdraweth not from the righteous His eyes, And [from] kings on the throne, And causeth them to sit for ever, and they are high,

<sup>8</sup> And if prisoners in fetters They are captured with cords of affliction,

<sup>9</sup> Then He declareth to them their work, And their transgressions, Because they have become mighty,

<sup>10</sup> And He uncovereth their ear for instruction, And saith that they turn back from iniquity.

<sup>11</sup> If they do hear and serve, They complete their days in good, And their years in pleasantness.

<sup>12</sup> And if they do not hearken, By the dart they pass away, And expire without knowledge.

<sup>13</sup> And the profane in heart set the face, They cry not when He hath bound them.

<sup>14</sup> Their soul dieth in youth, And their life among the defiled.

<sup>15</sup> He draweth out the afflicted in his affliction, And uncovereth in oppression their ear.

<sup>16</sup> And also He moved thee from a strait place, [To] a broad place — no straitness under it, And the sitting beyond of thy table Hath been full of fatness.

<sup>17</sup> And the judgment of the wicked thou hast fulfilled, Judgment and justice are upheld — because of fury,

<sup>18</sup> Lest He move thee with a stroke, And the abundance of an atonement turn thee not aside.

<sup>19</sup> Doth He value thy riches? He hath gold, and all the forces of power.

<sup>20</sup> Desire not the night, For the going up of peoples in their stead.

<sup>21</sup> Take heed — do not turn unto iniquity, For on this thou hast fixed Rather than [on] affliction.

<sup>22</sup> Lo, God doth sit on high by His power, Who [is] like Him — a teacher?

<sup>23</sup> Who hath appointed unto Him his way? And who said, 'Thou hast done iniquity?'

<sup>24</sup> Remember that thou magnify His work That men have beheld.

<sup>25</sup> All men have looked on it, Man looketh attentively from afar.

<sup>26</sup> Lo, God [is] high, And we know not the number of His years, Yea, there [is] no searching.

<sup>27</sup> When He doth diminish droppings of the waters, They refine rain according to its vapour,

<sup>28</sup> Which clouds do drop, They distil on man abundantly.

<sup>29</sup> Yea, doth [any] understand The spreadings out of a cloud? The noises of His tabernacle?

<sup>30</sup> Lo, He hath spread over it His light, And the roots of the sea He hath covered,

<sup>31</sup> For by them He doth judge peoples, He giveth food in abundance.

<sup>32</sup> By two palms He hath covered the light, And layeth a charge over it in meeting,

<sup>33</sup> He sheweth by it [to] his friend substance, Anger against perversity.
