# Chapter 40

<sup>1</sup> And Jehovah doth answer Job, and saith: —

<sup>2</sup> Is the striver with the Mighty instructed? The reprover of God, let him answer it.

<sup>3</sup> And Job answereth Jehovah, and saith: —

<sup>4</sup> Lo, I have been vile, What do I return to Thee? My hand I have placed on my mouth.

<sup>5</sup> Once I have spoken, and I answer not, And twice, and I add not.

<sup>6</sup> And Jehovah answereth Job out of the whirlwind, and saith: —

<sup>7</sup> Gird, I pray thee, as a man, thy loins, I ask thee, and cause thou Me to know.

<sup>8</sup> Dost thou also make void My judgment? Dost thou condemn Me, That thou mayest be righteous?

<sup>9</sup> And an arm like God hast thou? And with a voice like Him dost thou thunder?

<sup>10</sup> Put on, I pray thee, excellency and loftiness, Yea, honour and beauty put on.

<sup>11</sup> Scatter abroad the wrath of thine anger, And see every proud one, and make him low.

<sup>12</sup> See every proud one — humble him, And tread down the wicked in their place.

<sup>13</sup> Hide them in the dust together, Their faces bind in secret.

<sup>14</sup> And even I — I do praise thee, For thy right hand giveth salvation to thee.

<sup>15</sup> Lo, I pray thee, Behemoth, that I made with thee: Grass as an ox he eateth.

<sup>16</sup> Lo, I pray thee, his power [is] in his loins, And his strength in the muscles of his belly.

<sup>17</sup> He doth bend his tail as a cedar, The sinews of his thighs are wrapped together,

<sup>18</sup> His bones [are] tubes of brass, His bones [are] as a bar of iron.

<sup>19</sup> He [is] a beginning of the ways of God, His Maker bringeth nigh his sword;

<sup>20</sup> For food do mountains bear for him, And all the beasts of the field play there.

<sup>21</sup> Under shades he lieth down, In a secret place of reed and mire.

<sup>22</sup> Cover him do shades, [with] their shadow, Cover him do willows of the brook.

<sup>23</sup> Lo, a flood oppresseth — he doth not haste, He is confident though Jordan Doth come forth unto his mouth.

<sup>24</sup> Before his eyes doth [one] take him, With snares doth [one] pierce the nose?
