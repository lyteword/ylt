# Job 40 

**¹** And Jehovah doth answer Job, and saith: —

**²** Is the striver with the Mighty instructed? The reprover of God, let him answer it.

**³** And Job answereth Jehovah, and saith: —

**⁴** Lo, I have been vile, What do I return to Thee? My hand I have placed on my mouth.

**⁵** Once I have spoken, and I answer not, And twice, and I add not.

**⁶** And Jehovah answereth Job out of the whirlwind, and saith: —

**⁷** Gird, I pray thee, as a man, thy loins, I ask thee, and cause thou Me to know.

**⁸** Dost thou also make void My judgment? Dost thou condemn Me, That thou mayest be righteous?

**⁹** And an arm like God hast thou? And with a voice like Him dost thou thunder?

**¹⁰** Put on, I pray thee, excellency and loftiness, Yea, honour and beauty put on.

**¹¹** Scatter abroad the wrath of thine anger, And see every proud one, and make him low.

**¹²** See every proud one — humble him, And tread down the wicked in their place.

**¹³** Hide them in the dust together, Their faces bind in secret.

**¹⁴** And even I — I do praise thee, For thy right hand giveth salvation to thee.

**¹⁵** Lo, I pray thee, Behemoth, that I made with thee: Grass as an ox he eateth.

**¹⁶** Lo, I pray thee, his power [is] in his loins, And his strength in the muscles of his belly.

**¹⁷** He doth bend his tail as a cedar, The sinews of his thighs are wrapped together,

**¹⁸** His bones [are] tubes of brass, His bones [are] as a bar of iron.

**¹⁹** He [is] a beginning of the ways of God, His Maker bringeth nigh his sword;

**²⁰** For food do mountains bear for him, And all the beasts of the field play there.

**²¹** Under shades he lieth down, In a secret place of reed and mire.

**²²** Cover him do shades, [with] their shadow, Cover him do willows of the brook.

**²³** Lo, a flood oppresseth — he doth not haste, He is confident though Jordan Doth come forth unto his mouth.

**²⁴** Before his eyes doth [one] take him, With snares doth [one] pierce the nose?
