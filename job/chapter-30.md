# Chapter 30

<sup>1</sup> And now, laughed at me, Have the younger in days than I, Whose fathers I have loathed to set With the dogs of my flock.

<sup>2</sup> Also — the power of their hands, why [is it] to me? On them hath old age perished.

<sup>3</sup> With want and with famine gloomy, Those fleeing to a dry place, Formerly a desolation and waste,

<sup>4</sup> Those cropping mallows near a shrub, And broom-roots [is] their food.

<sup>5</sup> From the midst they are cast out, (They shout against them as a thief),

<sup>6</sup> In a frightful place of valleys to dwell, Holes of earth and clefts.

<sup>7</sup> Among shrubs they do groan, Under nettles they are gathered together.

<sup>8</sup> Sons of folly — even sons without name, They have been smitten from the land.

<sup>9</sup> And now, their song I have been, And I am to them for a byword.

<sup>10</sup> They have abominated me, They have kept far from me, And from before me have not spared to spit.

<sup>11</sup> Because His cord He loosed and afflicteth me, And the bridle from before me, They have cast away.

<sup>12</sup> On the right hand doth a brood arise, My feet they have cast away, And they raise up against me, Their paths of calamity.

<sup>13</sup> They have broken down my path, By my calamity they profit, 'He hath no helper.'

<sup>14</sup> As a wide breach they come, Under the desolation have rolled themselves.

<sup>15</sup> He hath turned against me terrors, It pursueth as the wind mine abundance, And as a thick cloud, Hath my safety passed away.

<sup>16</sup> And now, in me my soul poureth itself out, Seize me do days of affliction.

<sup>17</sup> At night my bone hath been pierced in me, And mine eyelids do not lie down.

<sup>18</sup> By the abundance of power, Is my clothing changed, As the mouth of my coat it doth gird me.

<sup>19</sup> Casting me into mire, And I am become like dust and ashes.

<sup>20</sup> I cry unto Thee, And Thou dost not answer me, I have stood, and Thou dost consider me.

<sup>21</sup> Thou art turned to be fierce to me, With the strength of Thy hand, Thou oppressest me.

<sup>22</sup> Thou dost lift me up, On the wind Thou dost cause me to ride, And Thou meltest — Thou levellest me.

<sup>23</sup> For I have known To death Thou dost bring me back, And [to] the house appointed for all living.

<sup>24</sup> Surely not against the heap Doth He send forth the hand, Though in its ruin they have safety.

<sup>25</sup> Did not I weep for him whose day is hard? Grieved hath my soul for the needy.

<sup>26</sup> When good I expected, then cometh evil, And I wait for light, and darkness cometh.

<sup>27</sup> My bowels have boiled, and have not ceased, Gone before me have days of affliction.

<sup>28</sup> Mourning I have gone without the sun, I have risen, in an assembly I cry.

<sup>29</sup> A brother I have been to dragons, And a companion to daughters of the ostrich.

<sup>30</sup> My skin hath been black upon me, And my bone hath burned from heat,

<sup>31</sup> And my harp doth become mourning, And my organ the sound of weeping.
