# Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> And Job answereth and saith: —

<sup>2</sup> Truly I have known that [it is] so, And what — is man righteous with God?

<sup>3</sup> If he delight to strive with Him — He doth not answer him one of a thousand.

<sup>4</sup> Wise in heart and strong in power — Who hath hardened toward Him and is at peace?

<sup>5</sup> Who is removing mountains, And they have not known, Who hath overturned them in His anger.

<sup>6</sup> Who is shaking earth from its place, And its pillars move themselves.

<sup>7</sup> Who is speaking to the sun, and it riseth not, And the stars He sealeth up.

<sup>8</sup> Stretching out the heavens by Himself, And treading on the heights of the sea,

<sup>9</sup> Making Osh, Kesil, and Kimah, And the inner chambers of the south.

<sup>10</sup> Doing great things till there is no searching, And wonderful, till there is no numbering.

<sup>11</sup> Lo, He goeth over by me, and I see not, And He passeth on, and I attend not to it.

<sup>12</sup> Lo, He snatches away, who bringeth it back? Who saith unto Him, 'What dost Thou?'

<sup>13</sup> God doth not turn back His anger, Under Him bowed have proud helpers.

<sup>14</sup> How much less do I — I answer Him? Choose out my words with Him?

<sup>15</sup> Whom, though I were righteous, I answer not, For my judgment I make supplication.

<sup>16</sup> Though I had called and He answereth me, I do not believe that He giveth ear [to] my voice.

<sup>17</sup> Because with a tempest He bruiseth me, And hath multiplied my wounds for nought.

<sup>18</sup> He permitteth me not to refresh my spirit, But filleth me with bitter things.

<sup>19</sup> If of power, lo, the Strong One; And if of judgment — who doth convene me?

<sup>20</sup> If I be righteous, Mine mouth doth declare me wicked, Perfect I am! — it declareth me perverse.

<sup>21</sup> Perfect I am! — I know not my soul, I despise my life.

<sup>22</sup> It is the same thing, therefore I said, 'The perfect and the wicked He is consuming.'

<sup>23</sup> If a scourge doth put to death suddenly, At the trial of the innocent He laugheth.

<sup>24</sup> Earth hath been given Into the hand of the wicked one. The face of its judges he covereth, If not — where, who [is] he?

<sup>25</sup> My days have been swifter than a runner, They have fled, they have not seen good,

<sup>26</sup> They have passed on with ships of reed, As an eagle darteth on food.

<sup>27</sup> Though I say, 'I forget my talking, I forsake my corner, and I brighten up!'

<sup>28</sup> I have been afraid of all my griefs, I have known that Thou dost not acquit me.

<sup>29</sup> I — I am become wicked; why [is] this? [In] vain I labour.

<sup>30</sup> If I have washed myself with snow-water, And purified with soap my hands,

<sup>31</sup> Then in corruption Thou dost dip me, And my garments have abominated me.

<sup>32</sup> But if a man like myself — I answer him, We come together into judgment.

<sup>33</sup> If there were between us an umpire, He doth place his hand on us both.

<sup>34</sup> He doth turn aside from off me his rod, And His terror doth not make me afraid,

<sup>35</sup> I speak, and do not fear Him, But I am not right with myself.
