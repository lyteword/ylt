# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> And Zophar the Naamathite answereth and saith: —

<sup>2</sup> Is a multitude of words not answered? And is a man of lips justified?

<sup>3</sup> Thy devices make men keep silent, Thou scornest, and none is causing blushing!

<sup>4</sup> And thou sayest, 'Pure [is] my discourse, And clean I have been in Thine eyes.'

<sup>5</sup> And yet, O that God had spoken! And doth open His lips with thee.

<sup>6</sup> And declare to thee secrets of wisdom, For counsel hath foldings. And know thou that God forgetteth for thee, [Some] of thine iniquity.

<sup>7</sup> By searching dost thou find out God? Unto perfection find out the Mighty One?

<sup>8</sup> Heights of the heavens! — what dost thou? Deeper than Sheol! — what knowest thou?

<sup>9</sup> Longer than earth [is] its measure, And broader than the sea.

<sup>10</sup> If He pass on, and shut up, and assemble, Who then dost reverse it?

<sup>11</sup> For he hath known men of vanity, And He seeth iniquity, And one doth not consider [it]!

<sup>12</sup> And empty man is bold, And the colt of a wild ass man is born.

<sup>13</sup> If thou — thou hast prepared thy heart, And hast spread out unto Him thy hands,

<sup>14</sup> If iniquity [is] in thy hand, put it far off, And let not perverseness dwell in thy tents.

<sup>15</sup> For then thou liftest up thy face from blemish, And thou hast been firm, and fearest not.

<sup>16</sup> For thou dost forget misery, As waters passed away thou rememberest.

<sup>17</sup> And above the noon doth age rise, Thou fliest — as the morning thou art.

<sup>18</sup> And thou hast trusted because their is hope, And searched — in confidence thou liest down,

<sup>19</sup> And thou hast rested, And none is causing trembling, And many have entreated thy face;

<sup>20</sup> And the eyes of the wicked are consumed, And refuge hath perished from them, And their hope [is] a breathing out of soul!
