# Job 11 

**¹** And Zophar the Naamathite answereth and saith: —

**²** Is a multitude of words not answered? And is a man of lips justified?

**³** Thy devices make men keep silent, Thou scornest, and none is causing blushing!

**⁴** And thou sayest, 'Pure [is] my discourse, And clean I have been in Thine eyes.'

**⁵** And yet, O that God had spoken! And doth open His lips with thee.

**⁶** And declare to thee secrets of wisdom, For counsel hath foldings. And know thou that God forgetteth for thee, [Some] of thine iniquity.

**⁷** By searching dost thou find out God? Unto perfection find out the Mighty One?

**⁸** Heights of the heavens! — what dost thou? Deeper than Sheol! — what knowest thou?

**⁹** Longer than earth [is] its measure, And broader than the sea.

**¹⁰** If He pass on, and shut up, and assemble, Who then dost reverse it?

**¹¹** For he hath known men of vanity, And He seeth iniquity, And one doth not consider [it]!

**¹²** And empty man is bold, And the colt of a wild ass man is born.

**¹³** If thou — thou hast prepared thy heart, And hast spread out unto Him thy hands,

**¹⁴** If iniquity [is] in thy hand, put it far off, And let not perverseness dwell in thy tents.

**¹⁵** For then thou liftest up thy face from blemish, And thou hast been firm, and fearest not.

**¹⁶** For thou dost forget misery, As waters passed away thou rememberest.

**¹⁷** And above the noon doth age rise, Thou fliest — as the morning thou art.

**¹⁸** And thou hast trusted because their is hope, And searched — in confidence thou liest down,

**¹⁹** And thou hast rested, And none is causing trembling, And many have entreated thy face;

**²⁰** And the eyes of the wicked are consumed, And refuge hath perished from them, And their hope [is] a breathing out of soul!
