# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> My soul hath been weary of my life, I leave off my talking to myself, I speak in the bitterness of my soul.

<sup>2</sup> I say unto God, 'Do not condemn me, Let me know why Thou dost strive [with] me.

<sup>3</sup> Is it good for Thee that Thou dost oppress? That Thou despisest the labour of Thy hands, And on the counsel of the wicked hast shone?

<sup>4</sup> Eyes of flesh hast Thou? As man seeth — seest Thou?

<sup>5</sup> As the days of man [are] Thy days? Thy years as the days of a man?

<sup>6</sup> That Thou inquirest for mine iniquity, And for my sin seekest?

<sup>7</sup> For Thou knowest that I am not wicked, And there is no deliverer from Thy hand.

<sup>8</sup> Thy hands have taken pains about me, And they make me together round about, And Thou swallowest me up!

<sup>9</sup> Remember, I pray Thee, That as clay Thou hast made me, And unto dust Thou dost bring me back.

<sup>10</sup> Dost Thou not as milk pour me out? And as cheese curdle me?

<sup>11</sup> Skin and flesh Thou dost put on me, And with bones and sinews dost fence me.

<sup>12</sup> Life and kindness Thou hast done with me. And Thy inspection hath preserved my spirit.

<sup>13</sup> And these Thou hast laid up in Thy heart, I have known that this [is] with Thee.

<sup>14</sup> If I sinned, then Thou hast observed me, And from mine iniquity dost not acquit me,

<sup>15</sup> If I have done wickedly — woe to me, And righteously — I lift not up my head, Full of shame — then see my affliction,

<sup>16</sup> And it riseth — as a lion Thou huntest me. And Thou turnest back — Thou shewest Thyself wonderful in me.

<sup>17</sup> Thou renewest Thy witnesses against me, And dost multiply Thine anger with me, Changes and warfare [are] with me.

<sup>18</sup> And why from the womb Hast Thou brought me forth? I expire, and the eye doth not see me.

<sup>19</sup> As I had not been, I am, From the belly to the grave I am brought,

<sup>20</sup> Are not my days few? Cease then, and put from me, And I brighten up a little,

<sup>21</sup> Before I go, and return not, Unto a land of darkness and death-shade,

<sup>22</sup> A land of obscurity as thick darkness, Death-shade — and no order, And the shining [is] as thick darkness.'
