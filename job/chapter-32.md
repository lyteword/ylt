# Chapter 32

<sup>1</sup> And these three men cease from answering Job, for he [is] righteous in his own eyes,

<sup>2</sup> and burn doth the anger of Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram; against Job hath his anger burned, because of his justifying himself more than God;

<sup>3</sup> and against his three friends hath his anger burned, because that they have not found an answer, and condemn Job.

<sup>4</sup> And Elihu hath waited earnestly beside Job with words, for they are older than he in days.

<sup>5</sup> And Elihu seeth that there is no answer in the mouth of the three men, and his anger burneth.

<sup>6</sup> And Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite answereth and saith: — Young I [am] in days, and ye [are] age Therefore I have feared, And am afraid of shewing you my opinion.

<sup>7</sup> I said: Days do speak, And multitude of years teach wisdom.

<sup>8</sup> Surely a spirit is in man, And the breath of the Mighty One Doth cause them to understand.

<sup>9</sup> The multitude are not wise, Nor do the aged understand judgment.

<sup>10</sup> Therefore I have said: Hearken to me, I do shew my opinion — even I.

<sup>11</sup> Lo, I have waited for your words, I give ear unto your reasons, Till ye search out sayings.

<sup>12</sup> And unto you I attend, And lo, there is no reasoner for Job, [Or] answerer of his sayings among you.

<sup>13</sup> Lest ye say, We have found wisdom, God doth thrust him away, not man.

<sup>14</sup> And he hath not set in array words for me, And with your sayings I do not answer him.

<sup>15</sup> (They have broken down, They have not answered again, They removed from themselves words.

<sup>16</sup> And I have waited, but they do not speak, For they have stood still, They have not answered any more.)

<sup>17</sup> I answer, even I — my share, I shew my opinion — even I.

<sup>18</sup> For I have been full of words, Distressed me hath the spirit of my breast,

<sup>19</sup> Lo, my breast [is] as wine not opened, Like new bottles it is broken up.

<sup>20</sup> I speak, and there is refreshment to me, I open my lips and answer.

<sup>21</sup> Let me not, I pray you, accept the face of any, Nor unto man give flattering titles,

<sup>22</sup> For I have not known to give flattering titles, In a little doth my Maker take me away.
