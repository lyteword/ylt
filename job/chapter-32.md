# Job 32 

**¹** And these three men cease from answering Job, for he [is] righteous in his own eyes,

**²** and burn doth the anger of Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram; against Job hath his anger burned, because of his justifying himself more than God;

**³** and against his three friends hath his anger burned, because that they have not found an answer, and condemn Job.

**⁴** And Elihu hath waited earnestly beside Job with words, for they are older than he in days.

**⁵** And Elihu seeth that there is no answer in the mouth of the three men, and his anger burneth.

**⁶** And Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite answereth and saith: — Young I [am] in days, and ye [are] age Therefore I have feared, And am afraid of shewing you my opinion.

**⁷** I said: Days do speak, And multitude of years teach wisdom.

**⁸** Surely a spirit is in man, And the breath of the Mighty One Doth cause them to understand.

**⁹** The multitude are not wise, Nor do the aged understand judgment.

**¹⁰** Therefore I have said: Hearken to me, I do shew my opinion — even I.

**¹¹** Lo, I have waited for your words, I give ear unto your reasons, Till ye search out sayings.

**¹²** And unto you I attend, And lo, there is no reasoner for Job, [Or] answerer of his sayings among you.

**¹³** Lest ye say, We have found wisdom, God doth thrust him away, not man.

**¹⁴** And he hath not set in array words for me, And with your sayings I do not answer him.

**¹⁵** (They have broken down, They have not answered again, They removed from themselves words.

**¹⁶** And I have waited, but they do not speak, For they have stood still, They have not answered any more.)

**¹⁷** I answer, even I — my share, I shew my opinion — even I.

**¹⁸** For I have been full of words, Distressed me hath the spirit of my breast,

**¹⁹** Lo, my breast [is] as wine not opened, Like new bottles it is broken up.

**²⁰** I speak, and there is refreshment to me, I open my lips and answer.

**²¹** Let me not, I pray you, accept the face of any, Nor unto man give flattering titles,

**²²** For I have not known to give flattering titles, In a little doth my Maker take me away.
