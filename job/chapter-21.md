# Job 21 

**¹** And Job answereth and saith: —

**²** Hear ye diligently my word, And this is your consolation.

**³** Bear with me, and I speak, And after my speaking — ye may deride.

**⁴** I — to man [is] my complaint? and if [so], wherefore May not my temper become short?

**⁵** Turn unto me, and be astonished, And put hand to mouth.

**⁶** Yea, if I have remembered, then I have been troubled. And my flesh hath taken fright.

**⁷** Wherefore do the wicked live? They have become old, Yea, they have been mighty in wealth.

**⁸** Their seed is established, Before their face with them, And their offspring before their eyes.

**⁹** Their houses [are] peace without fear, Nor [is] a rod of God upon them.

**¹⁰** His bullock hath eaten corn, and doth not loath. His cow bringeth forth safely, And doth not miscarry.

**¹¹** They send forth as a flock their sucklings, And their children skip,

**¹²** They lift [themselves] up at timbrel and harp, And rejoice at the sound of an organ.

**¹³** They wear out in good their days, And in a moment [to] Sheol go down.

**¹⁴** And they say to God, 'Turn aside from us, And the knowledge of Thy ways We have not desired.

**¹⁵** What [is] the Mighty One that we serve Him? And what do we profit when we meet with Him?'

**¹⁶** Lo, not in their hand [is] their good, (The counsel of the wicked Hath been far from me.)

**¹⁷** How oft is the lamp of the wicked extinguished, And come on them doth their calamity? Pangs He apportioneth in His anger.

**¹⁸** They are as straw before wind, And as chaff a hurricane hath stolen away,

**¹⁹** God layeth up for his sons his sorrow, He giveth recompense unto him — and he knoweth.

**²⁰** His own eyes see his destruction, And of the wrath of the Mighty he drinketh.

**²¹** For what [is] his delight in his house after him, And the number of his months cut off?

**²²** To God doth [one] teach knowledge, And He the high doth judge?

**²³** This [one] dieth in his perfect strength, Wholly at ease and quiet.

**²⁴** His breasts have been full of milk, And marrow his bones doth moisten.

**²⁵** And this [one] dieth with a bitter soul, And have not eaten with gladness.

**²⁶** Together — on the dust they lie down, And the worm doth cover them over.

**²⁷** Lo, I have known your thoughts, And the devices against me ye do wrongfully.

**²⁸** For ye say, 'Where [is] the house of the noble? And where the tent — The tabernacles of the wicked?'

**²⁹** Have ye not asked those passing by the way? And their signs do ye not know?

**³⁰** That to a day of calamity is the wicked spared. To a day of wrath they are brought.

**³¹** Who doth declare to his face his way? And [for] that which he hath done, Who doth give recompence to him?

**³²** And he — to the graves he is brought. And over the heap a watch is kept.

**³³** Sweet to him have been the clods of the valley, And after him every man he draweth, And before him there is no numbering.

**³⁴** And how do ye comfort me [with] vanity, And in your answers hath been left trespass?
