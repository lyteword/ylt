# Chapter 21

<sup>1</sup> And Job answereth and saith: —

<sup>2</sup> Hear ye diligently my word, And this is your consolation.

<sup>3</sup> Bear with me, and I speak, And after my speaking — ye may deride.

<sup>4</sup> I — to man [is] my complaint? and if [so], wherefore May not my temper become short?

<sup>5</sup> Turn unto me, and be astonished, And put hand to mouth.

<sup>6</sup> Yea, if I have remembered, then I have been troubled. And my flesh hath taken fright.

<sup>7</sup> Wherefore do the wicked live? They have become old, Yea, they have been mighty in wealth.

<sup>8</sup> Their seed is established, Before their face with them, And their offspring before their eyes.

<sup>9</sup> Their houses [are] peace without fear, Nor [is] a rod of God upon them.

<sup>10</sup> His bullock hath eaten corn, and doth not loath. His cow bringeth forth safely, And doth not miscarry.

<sup>11</sup> They send forth as a flock their sucklings, And their children skip,

<sup>12</sup> They lift [themselves] up at timbrel and harp, And rejoice at the sound of an organ.

<sup>13</sup> They wear out in good their days, And in a moment [to] Sheol go down.

<sup>14</sup> And they say to God, 'Turn aside from us, And the knowledge of Thy ways We have not desired.

<sup>15</sup> What [is] the Mighty One that we serve Him? And what do we profit when we meet with Him?'

<sup>16</sup> Lo, not in their hand [is] their good, (The counsel of the wicked Hath been far from me.)

<sup>17</sup> How oft is the lamp of the wicked extinguished, And come on them doth their calamity? Pangs He apportioneth in His anger.

<sup>18</sup> They are as straw before wind, And as chaff a hurricane hath stolen away,

<sup>19</sup> God layeth up for his sons his sorrow, He giveth recompense unto him — and he knoweth.

<sup>20</sup> His own eyes see his destruction, And of the wrath of the Mighty he drinketh.

<sup>21</sup> For what [is] his delight in his house after him, And the number of his months cut off?

<sup>22</sup> To God doth [one] teach knowledge, And He the high doth judge?

<sup>23</sup> This [one] dieth in his perfect strength, Wholly at ease and quiet.

<sup>24</sup> His breasts have been full of milk, And marrow his bones doth moisten.

<sup>25</sup> And this [one] dieth with a bitter soul, And have not eaten with gladness.

<sup>26</sup> Together — on the dust they lie down, And the worm doth cover them over.

<sup>27</sup> Lo, I have known your thoughts, And the devices against me ye do wrongfully.

<sup>28</sup> For ye say, 'Where [is] the house of the noble? And where the tent — The tabernacles of the wicked?'

<sup>29</sup> Have ye not asked those passing by the way? And their signs do ye not know?

<sup>30</sup> That to a day of calamity is the wicked spared. To a day of wrath they are brought.

<sup>31</sup> Who doth declare to his face his way? And [for] that which he hath done, Who doth give recompence to him?

<sup>32</sup> And he — to the graves he is brought. And over the heap a watch is kept.

<sup>33</sup> Sweet to him have been the clods of the valley, And after him every man he draweth, And before him there is no numbering.

<sup>34</sup> And how do ye comfort me [with] vanity, And in your answers hath been left trespass?
