# Chapter 29

<sup>1</sup> And Job addeth to lift up his simile, and saith: —

<sup>2</sup> Who doth make me as [in] months past, As [in] the days of God's preserving me?

<sup>3</sup> In His causing His lamp to shine on my head, By His light I walk [through] darkness.

<sup>4</sup> As I have been in days of my maturity, And the counsel of God upon my tent.

<sup>5</sup> When yet the Mighty One [is] with me. Round about me — my young ones,

<sup>6</sup> When washing my goings with butter, And the firm rock [is] with me rivulets of oil.

<sup>7</sup> When I go out to the gate by the city, In a broad place I prepare my seat.

<sup>8</sup> Seen me have youths, and they, been hidden, And the aged have risen — they stood up.

<sup>9</sup> Princes have kept in words, And a hand they place on their mouth.

<sup>10</sup> The voice of leaders hath been hidden, And their tongue to the palate hath cleaved.

<sup>11</sup> For the ear heard, and declareth me happy, And the eye hath seen, and testifieth [to] me.

<sup>12</sup> For I deliver the afflicted who is crying, And the fatherless who hath no helper.

<sup>13</sup> The blessing of the perishing cometh on me, And the heart of the widow I cause to sing.

<sup>14</sup> Righteousness I have put on, and it clotheth me, As a robe and a diadem my justice.

<sup>15</sup> Eyes I have been to the blind, And feet to the lame [am] I.

<sup>16</sup> A father I [am] to the needy, And the cause I have not known I search out.

<sup>17</sup> And I break the jaw-teeth of the perverse, And from his teeth I cast away prey.

<sup>18</sup> And I say, 'With my nest I expire, And as the sand I multiply days.'

<sup>19</sup> My root is open unto the waters, And dew doth lodge on my branch.

<sup>20</sup> My honour [is] fresh with me, And my bow in my hand is renewed.

<sup>21</sup> To me they have hearkened, Yea, they wait, and are silent for my counsel.

<sup>22</sup> After my word they change not, And on them doth my speech drop,

<sup>23</sup> And they wait as [for] rain for me, And their mouth they have opened wide [As] for the latter rain.

<sup>24</sup> I laugh unto them — they give no credence, And the light of my face cause not to fall.

<sup>25</sup> I choose their way, and sit head, And I dwell as a king in a troop, When mourners he doth comfort.
