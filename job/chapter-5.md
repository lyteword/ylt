# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> Pray, call, is there any to answer thee? And unto which of the holy ones dost thou turn?

<sup>2</sup> For provocation slayeth the perverse, And envy putteth to death the simple,

<sup>3</sup> I — I have seen the perverse taking root, And I mark his habitation straightway,

<sup>4</sup> Far are his sons from safety, And they are bruised in the gate, And there is no deliverer.

<sup>5</sup> Whose harvest the hungry doth eat, And even from the thorns taketh it, And the designing swallowed their wealth.

<sup>6</sup> For sorrow cometh not forth from the dust, Nor from the ground springeth up misery.

<sup>7</sup> For man to misery is born, And the sparks go high to fly.

<sup>8</sup> Yet I — I inquire for God, And for God I give my word,

<sup>9</sup> Doing great things, and there is no searching. Wonderful, till there is no numbering.

<sup>10</sup> Who is giving rain on the face of the land, And is sending waters on the out-places.

<sup>11</sup> To set the low on a high place, And the mourners have been high [in] safety.

<sup>12</sup> Making void thoughts of the subtile, And their hands do not execute wisdom.

<sup>13</sup> Capturing the wise in their subtilty, And the counsel of wrestling ones was hastened,

<sup>14</sup> By day they meet darkness, And as night — they grope at noon.

<sup>15</sup> And He saveth the wasted from their mouth, And from a strong hand the needy,

<sup>16</sup> And there is hope to the poor, And perverseness hath shut her mouth.

<sup>17</sup> Lo, the happiness of mortal man, God doth reprove him: And the chastisement of the Mighty despise not,

<sup>18</sup> For He doth pain, and He bindeth up, He smiteth, and His hands heal.

<sup>19</sup> In six distresses He delivereth thee, And in seven evil striketh not on thee.

<sup>20</sup> In famine He hath redeemed thee from death, And in battle from the hands of the sword.

<sup>21</sup> When the tongue scourgeth thou art hid, And thou art not afraid of destruction, When it cometh.

<sup>22</sup> At destruction and at hunger thou mockest, And of the beast of the earth, Thou art not afraid.

<sup>23</sup> (For with sons of the field [is] thy covenant, And the beast of the field Hath been at peace with thee.)

<sup>24</sup> And thou hast known that thy tent [is] peace, And inspected thy habitation, and errest not,

<sup>25</sup> And hast known that numerous [is] Thy seed, And thine offspring as the herb of the earth;

<sup>26</sup> Thou comest in full age unto the grave, As the going up of a stalk in its season.

<sup>27</sup> Lo, this — we searched it out — it [is] right, hearken; And thou, know for thyself!
