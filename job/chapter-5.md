# Job 5 

**¹** Pray, call, is there any to answer thee? And unto which of the holy ones dost thou turn?

**²** For provocation slayeth the perverse, And envy putteth to death the simple,

**³** I — I have seen the perverse taking root, And I mark his habitation straightway,

**⁴** Far are his sons from safety, And they are bruised in the gate, And there is no deliverer.

**⁵** Whose harvest the hungry doth eat, And even from the thorns taketh it, And the designing swallowed their wealth.

**⁶** For sorrow cometh not forth from the dust, Nor from the ground springeth up misery.

**⁷** For man to misery is born, And the sparks go high to fly.

**⁸** Yet I — I inquire for God, And for God I give my word,

**⁹** Doing great things, and there is no searching. Wonderful, till there is no numbering.

**¹⁰** Who is giving rain on the face of the land, And is sending waters on the out-places.

**¹¹** To set the low on a high place, And the mourners have been high [in] safety.

**¹²** Making void thoughts of the subtile, And their hands do not execute wisdom.

**¹³** Capturing the wise in their subtilty, And the counsel of wrestling ones was hastened,

**¹⁴** By day they meet darkness, And as night — they grope at noon.

**¹⁵** And He saveth the wasted from their mouth, And from a strong hand the needy,

**¹⁶** And there is hope to the poor, And perverseness hath shut her mouth.

**¹⁷** Lo, the happiness of mortal man, God doth reprove him: And the chastisement of the Mighty despise not,

**¹⁸** For He doth pain, and He bindeth up, He smiteth, and His hands heal.

**¹⁹** In six distresses He delivereth thee, And in seven evil striketh not on thee.

**²⁰** In famine He hath redeemed thee from death, And in battle from the hands of the sword.

**²¹** When the tongue scourgeth thou art hid, And thou art not afraid of destruction, When it cometh.

**²²** At destruction and at hunger thou mockest, And of the beast of the earth, Thou art not afraid.

**²³** (For with sons of the field [is] thy covenant, And the beast of the field Hath been at peace with thee.)

**²⁴** And thou hast known that thy tent [is] peace, And inspected thy habitation, and errest not,

**²⁵** And hast known that numerous [is] Thy seed, And thine offspring as the herb of the earth;

**²⁶** Thou comest in full age unto the grave, As the going up of a stalk in its season.

**²⁷** Lo, this — we searched it out — it [is] right, hearken; And thou, know for thyself!
