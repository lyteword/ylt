# Chapter 6

<sup>1</sup> And Job answereth and saith: —

<sup>2</sup> O that my provocation were thoroughly weighed, And my calamity in balances They would lift up together!

<sup>3</sup> For now, than the sands of the sea it is heavier, Therefore my words have been rash.

<sup>4</sup> For arrows of the Mighty [are] with me, Whose poison is drinking up my spirit. Terrors of God array themselves [for] me!

<sup>5</sup> Brayeth a wild ass over tender grass? Loweth an ox over his provender?

<sup>6</sup> Eaten is an insipid thing without salt? Is there sense in the drivel of dreams?

<sup>7</sup> My soul is refusing to touch! They [are] as my sickening food.

<sup>8</sup> O that my request may come, That God may grant my hope!

<sup>9</sup> That God would please — and bruise me, Loose His hand and cut me off!

<sup>10</sup> And yet it is my comfort, (And I exult in pain — He doth not spare,) That I have not hidden The sayings of the Holy One.

<sup>11</sup> What [is] my power that I should hope? And what mine end That I should prolong my life?

<sup>12</sup> Is my strength the strength of stones? Is my flesh brazen?

<sup>13</sup> Is not my help with me, And substance driven from me?

<sup>14</sup> To a despiser of his friends [is] shame, And the fear of the Mighty he forsaketh.

<sup>15</sup> My brethren have deceived as a brook, As a stream of brooks they pass away.

<sup>16</sup> That are black because of ice, By them doth snow hide itself.

<sup>17</sup> By the time they are warm they have been cut off, By its being hot they have been Extinguished from their place.

<sup>18</sup> Turn aside do the paths of their way, They ascend into emptiness, and are lost.

<sup>19</sup> Passengers of Tema looked expectingly, Travellers of Sheba hoped for them.

<sup>20</sup> They were ashamed that one hath trusted, They have come unto it and are confounded.

<sup>21</sup> Surely now ye have become the same! Ye see a downfall, and are afraid.

<sup>22</sup> Is it because I said, Give to me? And, By your power bribe for me?

<sup>23</sup> And, Deliver me from the hand of an adversary? And, From the hand of terrible ones ransom me?

<sup>24</sup> Shew me, and I — I keep silent, And what I have erred, let me understand.

<sup>25</sup> How powerful have been upright sayings, And what doth reproof from you reprove?

<sup>26</sup> For reproof — do you reckon words? And for wind — sayings of the desperate.

<sup>27</sup> Anger on the fatherless ye cause to fall, And are strange to your friend.

<sup>28</sup> And, now, please, look upon me, Even to your face do I lie?

<sup>29</sup> Turn back, I pray you, let it not be perverseness, Yea, turn back again — my righteousness [is] in it.

<sup>30</sup> Is there in my tongue perverseness? Discerneth not my palate desirable things?
