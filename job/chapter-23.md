# Chapter 23

<sup>1</sup> And Job answereth and saith: —

<sup>2</sup> Also — to-day [is] my complaint bitter, My hand hath been heavy because of my sighing.

<sup>3</sup> O that I had known — and I find Him, I come in unto His seat,

<sup>4</sup> I arrange before Him the cause, And my mouth fill [with] arguments.

<sup>5</sup> I know the words He doth answer me, And understand what He saith to me.

<sup>6</sup> In the abundance of power doth He strive with me? No! surely He putteth [it] in me.

<sup>7</sup> There the upright doth reason with Him, And I escape for ever from my judge.

<sup>8</sup> Lo, forward I go — and He is not, And backward — and I perceive him not.

<sup>9</sup> [To] the left in His working — and I see not, He is covered [on] the right, and I behold not.

<sup>10</sup> For He hath known the way with me, He hath tried me — as gold I go forth.

<sup>11</sup> On His step hath my foot laid hold, His way I have kept, and turn not aside,

<sup>12</sup> The command of His lips, and I depart not. Above my allotted portion I have laid up The sayings of His mouth.

<sup>13</sup> And He [is] in one [mind], And who doth turn Him back? And His soul hath desired — and He doth [it].

<sup>14</sup> For He doth complete my portion, And many such things [are] with Him.

<sup>15</sup> Therefore, from His presence I am troubled, I consider, and am afraid of Him.

<sup>16</sup> And God hath made my heart soft, And the Mighty hath troubled me.

<sup>17</sup> For I have not been cut off before darkness, And before me He covered thick darkness.
