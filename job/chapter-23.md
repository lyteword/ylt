# Job 23 

**¹** And Job answereth and saith: —

**²** Also — to-day [is] my complaint bitter, My hand hath been heavy because of my sighing.

**³** O that I had known — and I find Him, I come in unto His seat,

**⁴** I arrange before Him the cause, And my mouth fill [with] arguments.

**⁵** I know the words He doth answer me, And understand what He saith to me.

**⁶** In the abundance of power doth He strive with me? No! surely He putteth [it] in me.

**⁷** There the upright doth reason with Him, And I escape for ever from my judge.

**⁸** Lo, forward I go — and He is not, And backward — and I perceive him not.

**⁹** [To] the left in His working — and I see not, He is covered [on] the right, and I behold not.

**¹⁰** For He hath known the way with me, He hath tried me — as gold I go forth.

**¹¹** On His step hath my foot laid hold, His way I have kept, and turn not aside,

**¹²** The command of His lips, and I depart not. Above my allotted portion I have laid up The sayings of His mouth.

**¹³** And He [is] in one [mind], And who doth turn Him back? And His soul hath desired — and He doth [it].

**¹⁴** For He doth complete my portion, And many such things [are] with Him.

**¹⁵** Therefore, from His presence I am troubled, I consider, and am afraid of Him.

**¹⁶** And God hath made my heart soft, And the Mighty hath troubled me.

**¹⁷** For I have not been cut off before darkness, And before me He covered thick darkness.
