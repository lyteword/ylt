# Job 16 

**¹** And Job answereth and saith: —

**²** I have heard many such things, Miserable comforters [are] ye all.

**³** Is there an end to words of wind? Or what doth embolden thee that thou answerest?

**⁴** I also, like you, might speak, If your soul were in my soul's stead. I might join against you with words, And nod at you with my head.

**⁵** I might harden you with my mouth, And the moving of my lips might be sparing.

**⁶** If I speak, my pain is not restrained, And I cease — what goeth from me?

**⁷** Only, now, it hath wearied me; Thou hast desolated all my company,

**⁸** And Thou dost loathe me, For a witness it hath been, And rise up against me doth my failure, In my face it testifieth.

**⁹** His anger hath torn, and he hateth me, He hath gnashed at me with his teeth, My adversary sharpeneth his eyes for me.

**¹⁰** They have gaped on me with their mouth, In reproach they have smitten my cheeks, Together against me they set themselves.

**¹¹** God shutteth me up unto the perverse, And to the hands of the wicked turneth me over.

**¹²** At ease I have been, and he breaketh me, And he hath laid hold on my neck, And he breaketh me in pieces, And he raiseth me to him for a mark.

**¹³** Go round against me do his archers. He splitteth my reins, and spareth not, He poureth out to the earth my gall.

**¹⁴** He breaketh me — breach upon breach, He runneth upon me as a mighty one.

**¹⁵** Sackcloth I have sewed on my skin, And have rolled in the dust my horn.

**¹⁶** My face is foul with weeping, And on mine eyelids [is] death-shade.

**¹⁷** Not for violence in my hands, And my prayer [is] pure.

**¹⁸** O earth, do not thou cover my blood! And let there not be a place for my cry.

**¹⁹** Also, now, lo, in the heavens [is] my witness, And my testifier in the high places.

**²⁰** My interpreter [is] my friend, Unto God hath mine eye dropped:

**²¹** And he reasoneth for a man with God, And a son of man for his friend.

**²²** When a few years do come, Then a path I return not do I go.
