# Chapter 16

<sup>1</sup> And Job answereth and saith: —

<sup>2</sup> I have heard many such things, Miserable comforters [are] ye all.

<sup>3</sup> Is there an end to words of wind? Or what doth embolden thee that thou answerest?

<sup>4</sup> I also, like you, might speak, If your soul were in my soul's stead. I might join against you with words, And nod at you with my head.

<sup>5</sup> I might harden you with my mouth, And the moving of my lips might be sparing.

<sup>6</sup> If I speak, my pain is not restrained, And I cease — what goeth from me?

<sup>7</sup> Only, now, it hath wearied me; Thou hast desolated all my company,

<sup>8</sup> And Thou dost loathe me, For a witness it hath been, And rise up against me doth my failure, In my face it testifieth.

<sup>9</sup> His anger hath torn, and he hateth me, He hath gnashed at me with his teeth, My adversary sharpeneth his eyes for me.

<sup>10</sup> They have gaped on me with their mouth, In reproach they have smitten my cheeks, Together against me they set themselves.

<sup>11</sup> God shutteth me up unto the perverse, And to the hands of the wicked turneth me over.

<sup>12</sup> At ease I have been, and he breaketh me, And he hath laid hold on my neck, And he breaketh me in pieces, And he raiseth me to him for a mark.

<sup>13</sup> Go round against me do his archers. He splitteth my reins, and spareth not, He poureth out to the earth my gall.

<sup>14</sup> He breaketh me — breach upon breach, He runneth upon me as a mighty one.

<sup>15</sup> Sackcloth I have sewed on my skin, And have rolled in the dust my horn.

<sup>16</sup> My face is foul with weeping, And on mine eyelids [is] death-shade.

<sup>17</sup> Not for violence in my hands, And my prayer [is] pure.

<sup>18</sup> O earth, do not thou cover my blood! And let there not be a place for my cry.

<sup>19</sup> Also, now, lo, in the heavens [is] my witness, And my testifier in the high places.

<sup>20</sup> My interpreter [is] my friend, Unto God hath mine eye dropped:

<sup>21</sup> And he reasoneth for a man with God, And a son of man for his friend.

<sup>22</sup> When a few years do come, Then a path I return not do I go.
