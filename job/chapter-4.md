# Chapter 4

**¹** And Eliphaz the Temanite answereth and saith: —

**²** Hath one tried a word with thee? — Thou art weary! And to keep in words who is able?

**³** Lo, thou hast instructed many, And feeble hands thou makest strong.

**⁴** The stumbling one do thy words raise up, And bowing knees thou dost strengthen.

**⁵** But now, it cometh in unto thee, And thou art weary; It striketh unto thee, and thou art troubled.

**⁶** Is not thy reverence thy confidence? Thy hope — the perfection of thy ways?

**⁷** Remember, I pray thee, Who, being innocent, hath perished? And where have the upright been cut off?

**⁸** As I have seen — ploughers of iniquity, And sowers of misery, reap it!

**⁹** From the breath of God they perish, And from the spirit of His anger consumed.

**¹⁰** The roaring of a lion, And the voice of a fierce lion, And teeth of young lions have been broken.

**¹¹** An old lion is perishing without prey, And the whelps of the lioness do separate.

**¹²** And unto me a thing is secretly brought, And receive doth mine ear a little of it.

**¹³** In thoughts from visions of the night, In the falling of deep sleep on men,

**¹⁴** Fear hath met me, and trembling, And the multitude of my bones caused to fear.

**¹⁵** And a spirit before my face doth pass, Stand up doth the hair of my flesh;

**¹⁶** It standeth, and I discern not its aspect, A similitude [is] over-against mine eyes, Silence! and a voice I hear:

**¹⁷** 'Is mortal man than God more righteous? Than his Maker is a man cleaner?

**¹⁸** Lo, in His servants He putteth no credence, Nor in His messengers setteth praise.'

**¹⁹** Also — the inhabitants of houses of clay, (Whose foundation [is] in the dust, They bruise them before a moth.)

**²⁰** From morning to evening are beaten down, Without any regarding, for ever they perish.

**²¹** Hath not their excellency been removed with them? They die, and not in wisdom!
