# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> And Eliphaz the Temanite answereth and saith: —

<sup>2</sup> Hath one tried a word with thee? — Thou art weary! And to keep in words who is able?

<sup>3</sup> Lo, thou hast instructed many, And feeble hands thou makest strong.

<sup>4</sup> The stumbling one do thy words raise up, And bowing knees thou dost strengthen.

<sup>5</sup> But now, it cometh in unto thee, And thou art weary; It striketh unto thee, and thou art troubled.

<sup>6</sup> Is not thy reverence thy confidence? Thy hope — the perfection of thy ways?

<sup>7</sup> Remember, I pray thee, Who, being innocent, hath perished? And where have the upright been cut off?

<sup>8</sup> As I have seen — ploughers of iniquity, And sowers of misery, reap it!

<sup>9</sup> From the breath of God they perish, And from the spirit of His anger consumed.

<sup>10</sup> The roaring of a lion, And the voice of a fierce lion, And teeth of young lions have been broken.

<sup>11</sup> An old lion is perishing without prey, And the whelps of the lioness do separate.

<sup>12</sup> And unto me a thing is secretly brought, And receive doth mine ear a little of it.

<sup>13</sup> In thoughts from visions of the night, In the falling of deep sleep on men,

<sup>14</sup> Fear hath met me, and trembling, And the multitude of my bones caused to fear.

<sup>15</sup> And a spirit before my face doth pass, Stand up doth the hair of my flesh;

<sup>16</sup> It standeth, and I discern not its aspect, A similitude [is] over-against mine eyes, Silence! and a voice I hear:

<sup>17</sup> 'Is mortal man than God more righteous? Than his Maker is a man cleaner?

<sup>18</sup> Lo, in His servants He putteth no credence, Nor in His messengers setteth praise.'

<sup>19</sup> Also — the inhabitants of houses of clay, (Whose foundation [is] in the dust, They bruise them before a moth.)

<sup>20</sup> From morning to evening are beaten down, Without any regarding, for ever they perish.

<sup>21</sup> Hath not their excellency been removed with them? They die, and not in wisdom!
