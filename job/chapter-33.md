# Chapter 33

<sup>1</sup> And yet, I pray thee, O Job, Hear my speech and [to] all my words give ear.

<sup>2</sup> Lo, I pray thee, I have opened my mouth, My tongue hath spoken in the palate.

<sup>3</sup> Of the uprightness of my heart [are] my sayings, And knowledge have my lips clearly spoken.

<sup>4</sup> The Spirit of God hath made me, And the breath of the Mighty doth quicken me.

<sup>5</sup> If thou art able — answer me, Set in array before me — station thyself.

<sup>6</sup> Lo, I [am], according to thy word, for God, From the clay I — I also, have been formed.

<sup>7</sup> Lo, my terror doth not frighten thee, And my burden on thee is not heavy.

<sup>8</sup> Surely — thou hast said in mine ears, And the sounds of words I hear:

<sup>9</sup> 'Pure [am] I, without transgression, Innocent [am] I, and I have no iniquity.

<sup>10</sup> Lo, occasions against me He doth find, He doth reckon me for an enemy to Him,

<sup>11</sup> He doth put in the stocks my feet, He doth watch all my paths.'

<sup>12</sup> Lo, [in] this thou hast not been righteous, I answer thee, that greater is God than man.

<sup>13</sup> Wherefore against Him hast thou striven, When [for] all His matters He answereth not?

<sup>14</sup> For once doth God speak, and twice, (He doth not behold it.)

<sup>15</sup> In a dream — a vision of night, In the falling of deep sleep on men, In slumberings on a bed.

<sup>16</sup> Then He uncovereth the ear of men, And for their instruction sealeth:

<sup>17</sup> To turn aside man [from] doing, And pride from man He concealeth.

<sup>18</sup> He keepeth back his soul from corruption, And his life from passing away by a dart.

<sup>19</sup> And he hath been reproved With pain on his bed, And the strife of his bones [is] enduring.

<sup>20</sup> And his life hath nauseated bread, And his soul desirable food.

<sup>21</sup> His flesh is consumed from being seen, And high are his bones, they were not seen!

<sup>22</sup> And draw near to the pit doth his soul, And his life to those causing death.

<sup>23</sup> If there is by him a messenger, An interpreter — one of a thousand, To declare for man his uprightness:

<sup>24</sup> Then He doth favour him and saith, 'Ransom him from going down to the pit, I have found an atonement.'

<sup>25</sup> Fresher [is] his flesh than a child's, He returneth to the days of his youth.

<sup>26</sup> He maketh supplication unto God, And He accepteth him. And he seeth His face with shouting, And He returneth to man His righteousness.

<sup>27</sup> He looketh on men, and saith, 'I sinned, And uprightness I have perverted, And it hath not been profitable to me.

<sup>28</sup> He hath ransomed my soul From going over into the pit, And my life on the light looketh.'

<sup>29</sup> Lo, all these doth God work, Twice — thrice with man,

<sup>30</sup> To bring back his soul from the pit, To be enlightened with the light of the living.

<sup>31</sup> Attend, O Job, hearken to me, Keep silent, and I — I do speak.

<sup>32</sup> If there are words — answer me, Speak, for I have a desire to justify thee.

<sup>33</sup> If there are not — hearken thou to me, Keep silent, and I teach thee wisdom.
