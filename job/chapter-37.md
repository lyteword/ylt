# Job 37 

**¹** Also, at this my heart trembleth, And it moveth from its place.

**²** Hearken diligently to the trembling of His voice, Yea, the sound from His mouth goeth forth.

**³** Under the whole heavens He directeth it, And its light [is] over the skirts of the earth.

**⁴** After it roar doth a voice — He thundereth with the voice of His excellency, And He doth not hold them back, When His voice is heard.

**⁵** God thundereth with His voice wonderfully, Doing great things and we know not.

**⁶** For to snow He saith, 'Be [on] the earth.' And the small rain and great rain of His power.

**⁷** Into the hand of every man he sealeth, For the knowledge by all men of His work.

**⁸** And enter doth the beast into covert, And in its habitations it doth continue.

**⁹** From the inner chamber cometh a hurricane, And from scatterings winds — cold,

**¹⁰** From the breath of God is frost given, And the breadth of waters is straitened,

**¹¹** Yea, by filling He doth press out a cloud, Scatter a cloud doth His light.

**¹²** And it is turning itself round by His counsels, For their doing all He commandeth them, On the face of the habitable earth.

**¹³** Whether for a rod, or for His land, Or for kindness — He doth cause it to come.

**¹⁴** Hear this, O Job, Stand and consider the wonders of God.

**¹⁵** Dost thou know when God doth place them, And caused to shine the light of His cloud?

**¹⁶** Dost thou know the balancings of a cloud? The wonders of the Perfect in knowledge?

**¹⁷** How thy garments [are] warm, In the quieting of the earth from the south?

**¹⁸** Thou hast made an expanse with Him For the clouds — strong as a hard mirror!

**¹⁹** Let us know what we say to Him, We set not in array because of darkness.

**²⁰** Is it declared to Him that I speak? If a man hath spoken, surely he is swallowed up.

**²¹** And now, they have not seen the light, Bright it [is] in the clouds, And the wind hath passed by and cleanseth them.

**²²** From the golden north it cometh, Beside God [is] fearful honour.

**²³** The Mighty! we have not found Him out, High in power and judgment, He doth not answer! And abundant in righteousness,

**²⁴** Therefore do men fear Him, He seeth not any of the wise of heart.
