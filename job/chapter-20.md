# Chapter 20

<sup>1</sup> And Zophar the Naamathite answereth and saith: —

<sup>2</sup> Therefore my thoughts cause me to answer, And because of my sensations in me.

<sup>3</sup> The chastisement of my shame I hear, And the spirit of mine understanding Doth cause me to answer:

<sup>4</sup> This hast thou known from antiquity? Since the placing of man on earth?

<sup>5</sup> That the singing of the wicked [is] short, And the joy of the profane for a moment,

<sup>6</sup> Though his excellency go up to the heavens, And his head against a cloud he strike —

<sup>7</sup> As his own dung for ever he doth perish, His beholders say: 'Where [is] he?'

<sup>8</sup> As a dream he fleeth, and they find him not, And he is driven away as a vision of the night,

<sup>9</sup> The eye hath not seen him, and addeth not. And not again doth his place behold him.

<sup>10</sup> His sons do the poor oppress, And his hands give back his wealth.

<sup>11</sup> His bones have been full of his youth, And with him on the dust it lieth down.

<sup>12</sup> Though he doth sweeten evil in his mouth, Doth hide it under his tongue,

<sup>13</sup> Hath pity on it, and doth not forsake it, And keep it back in the midst of his palate,

<sup>14</sup> His food in his bowels is turned, The bitterness of asps [is] in his heart.

<sup>15</sup> Wealth he hath swallowed, and doth vomit it. From his belly God driveth it out.

<sup>16</sup> Gall of asps he sucketh, Slay him doth the tongue of a viper.

<sup>17</sup> He looketh not on rivulets, Flowing of brooks of honey and butter.

<sup>18</sup> He is giving back [what] he laboured for, And doth not consume [it]; As a bulwark [is] his exchange, and he exults not.

<sup>19</sup> For he oppressed — he forsook the poor, A house he hath taken violently away, And he doth not build it.

<sup>20</sup> For he hath not known ease in his belly. With his desirable thing he delivereth not himself.

<sup>21</sup> There is not a remnant to his food, Therefore his good doth not stay.

<sup>22</sup> In the fulness of his sufficiency he is straitened. Every perverse hand doth meet him.

<sup>23</sup> It cometh to pass, at the filling of his belly, He sendeth forth against him The fierceness of His anger, Yea, He raineth on him in his eating.

<sup>24</sup> He fleeth from an iron weapon, Pass through him doth a bow of brass.

<sup>25</sup> One hath drawn, And it cometh out from the body, And a glittering weapon from his gall proceedeth. On him [are] terrors.

<sup>26</sup> All darkness is hid for his treasures, Consume him doth a fire not blown, Broken is the remnant in his tent.

<sup>27</sup> Reveal do the heavens his iniquity, And earth is raising itself against him.

<sup>28</sup> Remove doth the increase of his house, Poured forth in a day of His anger.

<sup>29</sup> This [is] the portion of a wicked man from God. And an inheritance appointed him by God.
