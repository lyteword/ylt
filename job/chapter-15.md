# Chapter 15

<sup>1</sup> And Eliphaz the Temanite answereth and saith: —

<sup>2</sup> Doth a wise man answer [with] vain knowledge? And fill [with] an east wind his belly?

<sup>3</sup> To reason with a word not useful? And speeches — no profit in them?

<sup>4</sup> Yea, thou dost make reverence void, And dost diminish meditation before God.

<sup>5</sup> For thy mouth teacheth thine iniquity, And thou chooseth the tongue of the subtile.

<sup>6</sup> Thy mouth declareth thee wicked, and not I, And thy lips testify against thee.

<sup>7</sup> The first man art thou born? And before the heights wast thou formed?

<sup>8</sup> Of the secret counsel of God dost thou hear? And withdrawest thou unto thee wisdom?

<sup>9</sup> What hast thou known, and we know not? Understandest thou — and it is not with us?

<sup>10</sup> Both the gray-headed And the very aged [are] among us — Greater than thy father [in] days.

<sup>11</sup> Too few for thee are the comforts of God? And a gentle word [is] with thee,

<sup>12</sup> What — doth thine heart take thee away? And what — are thine eyes high?

<sup>13</sup> For thou turnest against God thy spirit? And hast brought out words from thy mouth:

<sup>14</sup> What [is] man that he is pure, And that he is righteous, one born of woman?

<sup>15</sup> Lo, in His holy ones He putteth no credence, And the heavens have not been pure in His eyes.

<sup>16</sup> Also — surely abominable and filthy Is man drinking as water perverseness.

<sup>17</sup> I shew thee — hearken to me — And this I have seen and declare:

<sup>18</sup> Which the wise declare — And have not hid — from their fathers.

<sup>19</sup> To them alone was the land given, And a stranger passed not over into their midst:

<sup>20</sup> 'All days of the wicked he is paining himself, And few years have been laid up for the terrible one.

<sup>21</sup> A fearful voice [is] in his ears, In peace doth a destroyer come to him.

<sup>22</sup> He believeth not to return from darkness, And watched [is] he for the sword.

<sup>23</sup> He is wandering for bread — 'Where [is] it?' He hath known that ready at his hand Is a day of darkness.

<sup>24</sup> Terrify him do adversity and distress, They prevail over him As a king ready for a boaster.

<sup>25</sup> For he stretched out against God his hand, And against the Mighty he maketh himself mighty.

<sup>26</sup> He runneth unto Him with a neck, With thick bosses of his shields.

<sup>27</sup> For he hath covered his face with his fat, And maketh vigour over [his] confidence.

<sup>28</sup> And he inhabiteth cities cut off, houses not dwelt in, That have been ready to become heaps.

<sup>29</sup> He is not rich, nor doth his wealth rise, Nor doth he stretch out on earth their continuance.

<sup>30</sup> He turneth not aside from darkness, His tender branch doth a flame dry up, And he turneth aside at the breath of His mouth!

<sup>31</sup> Let him not put credence in vanity, He hath been deceived, For vanity is his recompence.

<sup>32</sup> Not in his day is it completed, And his bending branch is not green.

<sup>33</sup> He shaketh off as a vine his unripe fruit, And casteth off as an olive his blossom.

<sup>34</sup> For the company of the profane [is] gloomy, And fire hath consumed tents of bribery.

<sup>35</sup> To conceive misery, and to bear iniquity, Even their heart doth prepare deceit.
