# Job 15 

**¹** And Eliphaz the Temanite answereth and saith: —

**²** Doth a wise man answer [with] vain knowledge? And fill [with] an east wind his belly?

**³** To reason with a word not useful? And speeches — no profit in them?

**⁴** Yea, thou dost make reverence void, And dost diminish meditation before God.

**⁵** For thy mouth teacheth thine iniquity, And thou chooseth the tongue of the subtile.

**⁶** Thy mouth declareth thee wicked, and not I, And thy lips testify against thee.

**⁷** The first man art thou born? And before the heights wast thou formed?

**⁸** Of the secret counsel of God dost thou hear? And withdrawest thou unto thee wisdom?

**⁹** What hast thou known, and we know not? Understandest thou — and it is not with us?

**¹⁰** Both the gray-headed And the very aged [are] among us — Greater than thy father [in] days.

**¹¹** Too few for thee are the comforts of God? And a gentle word [is] with thee,

**¹²** What — doth thine heart take thee away? And what — are thine eyes high?

**¹³** For thou turnest against God thy spirit? And hast brought out words from thy mouth:

**¹⁴** What [is] man that he is pure, And that he is righteous, one born of woman?

**¹⁵** Lo, in His holy ones He putteth no credence, And the heavens have not been pure in His eyes.

**¹⁶** Also — surely abominable and filthy Is man drinking as water perverseness.

**¹⁷** I shew thee — hearken to me — And this I have seen and declare:

**¹⁸** Which the wise declare — And have not hid — from their fathers.

**¹⁹** To them alone was the land given, And a stranger passed not over into their midst:

**²⁰** 'All days of the wicked he is paining himself, And few years have been laid up for the terrible one.

**²¹** A fearful voice [is] in his ears, In peace doth a destroyer come to him.

**²²** He believeth not to return from darkness, And watched [is] he for the sword.

**²³** He is wandering for bread — 'Where [is] it?' He hath known that ready at his hand Is a day of darkness.

**²⁴** Terrify him do adversity and distress, They prevail over him As a king ready for a boaster.

**²⁵** For he stretched out against God his hand, And against the Mighty he maketh himself mighty.

**²⁶** He runneth unto Him with a neck, With thick bosses of his shields.

**²⁷** For he hath covered his face with his fat, And maketh vigour over [his] confidence.

**²⁸** And he inhabiteth cities cut off, houses not dwelt in, That have been ready to become heaps.

**²⁹** He is not rich, nor doth his wealth rise, Nor doth he stretch out on earth their continuance.

**³⁰** He turneth not aside from darkness, His tender branch doth a flame dry up, And he turneth aside at the breath of His mouth!

**³¹** Let him not put credence in vanity, He hath been deceived, For vanity is his recompence.

**³²** Not in his day is it completed, And his bending branch is not green.

**³³** He shaketh off as a vine his unripe fruit, And casteth off as an olive his blossom.

**³⁴** For the company of the profane [is] gloomy, And fire hath consumed tents of bribery.

**³⁵** To conceive misery, and to bear iniquity, Even their heart doth prepare deceit.
