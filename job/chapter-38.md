# Chapter 38

<sup>1</sup> And Jehovah answereth Job out of the whirlwind, and saith: —

<sup>2</sup> Who [is] this — darkening counsel, By words without knowledge?

<sup>3</sup> Gird, I pray thee, as a man, thy loins, And I ask thee, and cause thou Me to know.

<sup>4</sup> Where wast thou when I founded earth? Declare, if thou hast known understanding.

<sup>5</sup> Who placed its measures — if thou knowest? Or who hath stretched out upon it a line?

<sup>6</sup> On what have its sockets been sunk? Or who hath cast its corner-stone?

<sup>7</sup> In the singing together of stars of morning, And all sons of God shout for joy,

<sup>8</sup> And He shutteth up with doors the sea, In its coming forth, from the womb it goeth out.

<sup>9</sup> In My making a cloud its clothing, And thick darkness its swaddling band,

<sup>10</sup> And I measure over it My statute, And place bar and doors,

<sup>11</sup> And say, 'Hitherto come thou, and add not, And a command is placed On the pride of thy billows.'

<sup>12</sup> Hast thou commanded morning since thy days? Causest thou the dawn to know its place?

<sup>13</sup> To take hold on the skirts of the earth, And the wicked are shaken out of it,

<sup>14</sup> It turneth itself as clay of a seal And they station themselves as clothed.

<sup>15</sup> And withheld from the wicked is their light, And the arm lifted up is broken.

<sup>16</sup> Hast thou come in to springs of the sea? And in searching the deep Hast thou walked up and down?

<sup>17</sup> Revealed to thee were the gates of death? And the gates of death-shade dost thou see?

<sup>18</sup> Thou hast understanding, Even unto the broad places of earth! Declare — if thou hast known it all.

<sup>19</sup> Where [is] this — the way light dwelleth? And darkness, where [is] this — its place?

<sup>20</sup> That thou dost take it unto its boundary, And that thou dost understand The paths of its house.

<sup>21</sup> Thou hast known — for then thou art born And the number of thy days [are] many!

<sup>22</sup> Hast thou come in unto the treasure of snow? Yea, the treasures of hail dost thou see?

<sup>23</sup> That I have kept back for a time of distress, For a day of conflict and battle.

<sup>24</sup> Where [is] this, the way light is apportioned? It scattereth an east wind over the earth.

<sup>25</sup> Who hath divided for the flood a conduit? And a way for the lightning of the voices?

<sup>26</sup> To cause [it] to rain on a land — no man, A wilderness — no man in it.

<sup>27</sup> To satisfy a desolate and waste place, And to cause to shoot up The produce of the tender grass?

<sup>28</sup> Hath the rain a father? Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?

<sup>29</sup> From whose belly came forth the ice? And the hoar-frost of the heavens, Who hath begotten it?

<sup>30</sup> As a stone waters are hidden, And the face of the deep is captured.

<sup>31</sup> Dost thou bind sweet influences of Kimah? Or the attractions of Kesil dost thou open?

<sup>32</sup> Dost thou bring out Mazzaroth in its season? And Aysh for her sons dost thou comfort?

<sup>33</sup> Hast thou known the statutes of heaven? Or dost thou appoint Its dominion in the earth?

<sup>34</sup> Dost thou lift up to the cloud thy voice, And abundance of water doth cover thee?

<sup>35</sup> Dost thou send out lightnings, and they go And say unto thee, 'Behold us?'

<sup>36</sup> Who hath put in the inward parts wisdom? Or who hath given To the covered part understanding?

<sup>37</sup> Who doth number the clouds by wisdom? And the bottles of the heavens, Who doth cause to lie down,

<sup>38</sup> In the hardening of dust into hardness, And clods cleave together?

<sup>39</sup> Dost thou hunt for a lion prey? And the desire of young lions fulfil?

<sup>40</sup> When they bow down in dens — Abide in a thicket for a covert?

<sup>41</sup> Who doth prepare for a raven his provision, When his young ones cry unto God? They wander without food.
