# Job 34 

**¹** And Elihu answereth and saith:

**²** Hear, O wise men, my words, And, O knowing ones, give ear to me.

**³** For the ear doth try words, And the palate tasteth to eat.

**⁴** Judgment let us choose for ourselves, Let us know among ourselves what [is] good.

**⁵** For Job hath said, 'I have been righteous, And God hath turned aside my right,

**⁶** Against my right do I lie? Mortal [is] mine arrow — without transgression.'

**⁷** Who [is] a man like Job? He drinketh scoffing like water,

**⁸** And he hath travelled for company With workers of iniquity, So as to go with men of wickedness.

**⁹** For he hath said, 'It doth not profit a man, When he delighteth himself with God.'

**¹⁰** Therefore, O men of heart, hearken to me; Far be it from God to do wickedness, And [from] the Mighty to do perverseness:

**¹¹** For the work of man he repayeth to him, And according to the path of each He doth cause him to find.

**¹²** Yea, truly, God doth not do wickedly, And the Mighty doth not pervert judgment.

**¹³** Who hath inspected for Himself the earth? And who hath placed all the habitable world?

**¹⁴** If He doth set on him His heart, His spirit and his breath unto Him He gathereth.

**¹⁵** Expire doth all flesh together, And man to dust returneth.

**¹⁶** And if [there is] understanding, hear this, Give ear to the voice of my words.

**¹⁷** Yea, doth one hating justice govern? Or the Most Just dost thou condemn?

**¹⁸** Who hath said to a king — 'Worthless,' Unto princes — 'Wicked?'

**¹⁹** That hath not accepted the person of princes, Nor hath known the rich before the poor, For a work of His hands [are] all of them.

**²⁰** [In] a moment they die, and at midnight Shake do people, and they pass away, And they remove the mighty without hand.

**²¹** For His eyes [are] on the ways of each, And all his steps He doth see.

**²²** There is no darkness nor death-shade, For workers of iniquity to be hidden there;

**²³** For He doth not suffer man any more, To go unto God in judgment,

**²⁴** He breaketh the mighty — no searching! And He appointeth others in their stead.

**²⁵** Therefore He knoweth their works, And He hath overturned by night, And they are bruised.

**²⁶** As wicked He hath stricken them, In the place of beholders.

**²⁷** Because that against right They have turned aside from after Him, And none of His ways have considered wisely,

**²⁸** To cause to come in unto Him The cry of the poor, And the cry of the afflicted He heareth.

**²⁹** And He giveth rest, and who maketh wrong? And hideth the face, and who beholdeth it? And in reference to a nation and to a man, [It is] the same.

**³⁰** From the reigning of a profane man, From the snares of a people;

**³¹** For unto God hath any said: 'I have taken away, I do not corruptly,

**³²** Besides [that which] I see, shew Thou me, If iniquity I have done — I do not add?'

**³³** By thee doth He recompense, That thou hast refused — That thou dost choose, and not I? And what thou hast known, speak.

**³⁴** Let men of heart say to me, And a wise man is hearkening to me.

**³⁵** Job — not with knowledge doth he speak, And his words [are] not with wisdom.

**³⁶** My Father! let Job be tried — unto victory, Because of answers for men of iniquity,

**³⁷** For he doth add to his sin, Transgression among us he vomiteth, And multiplieth his sayings to God.
