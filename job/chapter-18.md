# Chapter 18

<sup>1</sup> And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith: —

<sup>2</sup> When do ye set an end to words? Consider ye, and afterwards do we speak.

<sup>3</sup> Wherefore have we been reckoned as cattle? We have been defiled in your eyes!

<sup>4</sup> (He is tearing himself in his anger.) For thy sake is earth forsaken? And removed is a rock from its place?

<sup>5</sup> Also, the light of the wicked is extinguished. And there doth not shine a spark of his fire.

<sup>6</sup> The light hath been dark in his tent, And his lamp over him is extinguished.

<sup>7</sup> Straitened are the steps of his strength, And cast him down doth his own counsel.

<sup>8</sup> For he is sent into a net by his own feet, And on a snare he doth walk habitually.

<sup>9</sup> Seize on the heel doth a gin, Prevail over him do the designing.

<sup>10</sup> Hidden in the earth is his cord, And his trap on the path.

<sup>11</sup> Round about terrified him have terrors, And they have scattered him — at his feet.

<sup>12</sup> Hungry is his sorrow, And calamity is ready at his side.

<sup>13</sup> It consumeth the parts of his skin, Consume his parts doth death's first-born.

<sup>14</sup> Drawn from his tent is his confidence, And it causeth him to step to the king of terrors.

<sup>15</sup> It dwelleth in his tent — out of his provender, Scattered over his habitation is sulphur.

<sup>16</sup> From beneath his roots are dried up, And from above cut off is his crop.

<sup>17</sup> His memorial hath perished from the land, And he hath no name on the street.

<sup>18</sup> They thrust him from light unto darkness, And from the habitable earth cast him out.

<sup>19</sup> He hath no continuator, Nor successor among his people, And none is remaining in his dwellings.

<sup>20</sup> At this day westerns have been astonished And easterns have taken fright.

<sup>21</sup> Only these [are] tabernacles of the perverse, And this the place God hath not known.
