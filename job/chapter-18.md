# Job 18 

**¹** And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith: —

**²** When do ye set an end to words? Consider ye, and afterwards do we speak.

**³** Wherefore have we been reckoned as cattle? We have been defiled in your eyes!

**⁴** (He is tearing himself in his anger.) For thy sake is earth forsaken? And removed is a rock from its place?

**⁵** Also, the light of the wicked is extinguished. And there doth not shine a spark of his fire.

**⁶** The light hath been dark in his tent, And his lamp over him is extinguished.

**⁷** Straitened are the steps of his strength, And cast him down doth his own counsel.

**⁸** For he is sent into a net by his own feet, And on a snare he doth walk habitually.

**⁹** Seize on the heel doth a gin, Prevail over him do the designing.

**¹⁰** Hidden in the earth is his cord, And his trap on the path.

**¹¹** Round about terrified him have terrors, And they have scattered him — at his feet.

**¹²** Hungry is his sorrow, And calamity is ready at his side.

**¹³** It consumeth the parts of his skin, Consume his parts doth death's first-born.

**¹⁴** Drawn from his tent is his confidence, And it causeth him to step to the king of terrors.

**¹⁵** It dwelleth in his tent — out of his provender, Scattered over his habitation is sulphur.

**¹⁶** From beneath his roots are dried up, And from above cut off is his crop.

**¹⁷** His memorial hath perished from the land, And he hath no name on the street.

**¹⁸** They thrust him from light unto darkness, And from the habitable earth cast him out.

**¹⁹** He hath no continuator, Nor successor among his people, And none is remaining in his dwellings.

**²⁰** At this day westerns have been astonished And easterns have taken fright.

**²¹** Only these [are] tabernacles of the perverse, And this the place God hath not known.
