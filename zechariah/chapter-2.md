# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> And I lift up mine eyes, and look, and lo, a man, and in his hand a measuring line.

<sup>2</sup> And I say, 'Whither are thou going?' And he saith unto me, 'To measure Jerusalem, to see how much [is] its breadth, and how much its length.'

<sup>3</sup> And lo, the messenger who is speaking with me is going out, and another messenger is going out to meet him,

<sup>4</sup> and he saith unto him, 'Run, speak unto this young man, saying: Unwalled villages inhabit doth Jerusalem, From the abundance of man and beast in her midst.

<sup>5</sup> And I — I am to her — an affirmation of Jehovah, A wall of fire round about, And for honour I am in her midst.

<sup>6</sup> Ho, ho, and flee from the land of the north, An affirmation of Jehovah, For, as the four winds of the heavens, I have spread you abroad, An affirmation of Jehovah.

<sup>7</sup> Ho, Zion, be delivered who art dwelling [with] the daughter of Babylon.

<sup>8</sup> For thus said Jehovah of Hosts: After honour He hath sent me unto the nations who are spoiling you, For he who is coming against you, Is coming against the daughter of His eye.

<sup>9</sup> For lo, I am waving my hand against them, And they have been a spoil to their servants. And ye have known that Jehovah of Hosts hath sent me.

<sup>10</sup> Singe, and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, For lo, I am coming, and have dwelt in thy midst, An affirmation of Jehovah.

<sup>11</sup> And joined have been many nations unto Jehovah in that day, And they have been to Me for a people, And I have dwelt in thy midst, And thou hast known that Jehovah of Hosts hath sent me unto thee.

<sup>12</sup> And Jehovah hath inherited Judah, His portion on the holy ground, And He hath fixed again on Jerusalem.

<sup>13</sup> Hush, all flesh, because of Jehovah, For He hath been roused up from His holy habitation!'
