# Zechariah 2 

**¹** And I lift up mine eyes, and look, and lo, a man, and in his hand a measuring line.

**²** And I say, 'Whither are thou going?' And he saith unto me, 'To measure Jerusalem, to see how much [is] its breadth, and how much its length.'

**³** And lo, the messenger who is speaking with me is going out, and another messenger is going out to meet him,

**⁴** and he saith unto him, 'Run, speak unto this young man, saying: Unwalled villages inhabit doth Jerusalem, From the abundance of man and beast in her midst.

**⁵** And I — I am to her — an affirmation of Jehovah, A wall of fire round about, And for honour I am in her midst.

**⁶** Ho, ho, and flee from the land of the north, An affirmation of Jehovah, For, as the four winds of the heavens, I have spread you abroad, An affirmation of Jehovah.

**⁷** Ho, Zion, be delivered who art dwelling [with] the daughter of Babylon.

**⁸** For thus said Jehovah of Hosts: After honour He hath sent me unto the nations who are spoiling you, For he who is coming against you, Is coming against the daughter of His eye.

**⁹** For lo, I am waving my hand against them, And they have been a spoil to their servants. And ye have known that Jehovah of Hosts hath sent me.

**¹⁰** Singe, and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, For lo, I am coming, and have dwelt in thy midst, An affirmation of Jehovah.

**¹¹** And joined have been many nations unto Jehovah in that day, And they have been to Me for a people, And I have dwelt in thy midst, And thou hast known that Jehovah of Hosts hath sent me unto thee.

**¹²** And Jehovah hath inherited Judah, His portion on the holy ground, And He hath fixed again on Jerusalem.

**¹³** Hush, all flesh, because of Jehovah, For He hath been roused up from His holy habitation!'
