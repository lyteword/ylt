# Chapter 4

**¹** And the messenger who is speaking with me doth turn back, and stir me up as one who is stirred up out of his sleep,

**²** and he saith unto me, 'What art thou seeing?' And I say, 'I have looked, and lo, a candlestick of gold — all of it, and its bowl [is] on its top, and its seven lamps [are] upon it, and twice seven pipes [are] to the lights that [are] on its top,

**³** and two olive-trees [are] by it, one on the right of the bowl, and one on its left.'

**⁴** And I answer and speak unto the messenger who is speaking with me, saying, 'What [are] these, my lord?'

**⁵** And the messenger who is speaking with me answereth and saith unto me, 'Hast thou not known what these [are]?' And I say, 'No, my lord.'

**⁶** And he answereth and speaketh unto me, saying: 'This [is] a word of Jehovah unto Zerubbabel, saying: Not by a force, nor by power, But — by My Spirit, said Jehovah of Hosts.

**⁷** Who [art] thou, O great mountain Before Zerubbabel — for a plain! And he hath brought forth the top-stone, Cries of Grace, grace — [are] to it.'

**⁸** And there is a word of Jehovah to me, saying,

**⁹** Hands of Zerubbabel did found this house, And his hands do finish it, And thou hast known that Jehovah of Hosts Hath sent me unto you.

**¹⁰** For who trampled on the day of small things, They have rejoiced, And seen the tin weight in the hand of Zerubbabel, These seven [are] the eyes of Jehovah, They are going to and fro in all the land.'

**¹¹** And I answer and say unto him, 'What [are] these two olive-trees, on the right of the candlestick, and on its left?'

**¹²** And I answer a second time, and say unto him, 'What [are] the two branches of the olive trees that, by means of the two golden pipes, are emptying out of themselves the oil?'

**¹³** And he speaketh unto me, saying, 'Hast thou not known what these [are]?' And I say, 'No, my lord.'

**¹⁴** And he saith, 'These [are] the two sons of the oil, who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.'
