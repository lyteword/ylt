# Ezekiel 35 

**¹** And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying:

**²** 'Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,

**³** and thou hast said to it: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I [am] against thee, O mount Seir, And have stretched out My hand against thee, And made thee a desolation and an astonishment.

**⁴** Thy cities a waste I make, and thou art a desolation, And thou hast known that I [am] Jehovah.

**⁵** Because of thy having an enmity age-during, And thou dost saw the sons of Israel, By the hands of the sword, In the time of their calamity, In the time of the iniquity of the end:

**⁶** Therefore, I live — an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah, Surely for blood I do appoint thee, And blood doth pursue thee, If blood thou hast not hated, Blood also doth pursue thee.

**⁷** And I have given mount Seir for a desolation and an astonishment, And have cut off from it him who is passing over and him who is returning,

**⁸** And filled his mountains with his wounded, Thy hills, and thy valleys, and all thy streams, The pierced of the sword fall into them.

**⁹** Desolations age-during I make thee, And thy cities do not return, And ye have known that I [am] Jehovah.

**¹⁰** Because of thy saying: The two nations and the two lands are mine, and we have possessed it, And Jehovah hath been there;

**¹¹** Therefore, I live — an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah, And I have done according to thine anger, And according to thine envy, With which thou hast wrought, Because of thy hatred against them, And I have been known among them when I judge thee.

**¹²** And thou hast known that I — Jehovah, I have heard all thy despisings that thou hast spoken Against mountains of Israel, saying: A desolation, to us they were given for food.

**¹³** And ye magnify yourselves against Me with your mouth, And have made abundant against Me your words, I — I have heard.

**¹⁴** Thus said the Lord Jehovah: According to the rejoicing of the whole land, A desolation I make of thee.

**¹⁵** According to thy joy at the inheritance of the house of Israel because of desolation, So I do to thee — a desolation thou art, O mount Seir, and all Edom — all of it, And they have known that I [am] Jehovah!
