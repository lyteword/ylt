# Chapter 7

<sup>1</sup> And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying, 'And thou, son of man, Thus said the Lord Jehovah to the ground of Israel:

<sup>2</sup> An end, come hath the end on the four corners of the land.

<sup>3</sup> Now [is] the end unto thee, And I have sent Mine anger upon thee, And judged thee according to thy ways, And set against thee all thine abominations.

<sup>4</sup> And no pity on thee hath Mine eye, nor do I spare, For thy ways against thee I do set, And thine abominations are in thy midst, And ye have known that I [am] Jehovah.

<sup>5</sup> Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Evil, a single evil, lo, it hath come.

<sup>6</sup> An end hath come, come hath the end, It hath waked for thee, lo, it hath come.

<sup>7</sup> Come hath the morning unto thee, O inhabitant of the land! Come hath the time, near [is] a day of trouble, And not the shouting of mountains.

<sup>8</sup> Now, shortly I pour out My fury on thee, And have completed Mine anger against thee, And judged thee according to thy ways, And set against thee all thine abominations.

<sup>9</sup> And not pity doth Mine eye, nor do I spare, According to thy ways unto thee I give, And thine abominations are in thy midst, And ye have known that I [am] Jehovah the smiter.

<sup>10</sup> Lo, the day, lo, it hath come, Gone forth hath the morning, Blossomed hath the rod, flourished the pride.

<sup>11</sup> The violence hath risen to a rod of wickedness, There is none of them, nor of their multitude, Nor of their noise, nor is there wailing for them.

<sup>12</sup> Come hath the time, arrived hath the day, The buyer doth not rejoice, And the seller doth not become a mourner, For wrath [is] unto all its multitude.

<sup>13</sup> For the seller to the sold thing turneth not, And yet among the living [is] their life, For the vision [is] unto all its multitude, It doth not turn back, And none by his iniquity doth strengthen his life.

<sup>14</sup> They have blown with a trumpet to prepare the whole, And none is going to battle, For My wrath [is] unto all its multitude.

<sup>15</sup> The sword [is] without, And the pestilence and the famine within, He who is in a field by sword dieth, And he who is in a city, Famine and pestilence devour him.

<sup>16</sup> And escaped away have their fugitives, And they have been on the mountains As doves of the valleys, All of them make a noising — each for his iniquity.

<sup>17</sup> All the hands are feeble, and all knees go — waters.

<sup>18</sup> And they have girded on sackcloth, And covered them hath trembling, And unto all faces [is] shame, And on all their heads — baldness.

<sup>19</sup> Their silver into out-places they cast, And their gold impurity becometh. Their silver and their gold is not able to deliver them, In a day of the wrath of Jehovah, Their soul they do not satisfy, And their bowels they do not fill, For the stumbling-block of their iniquity it hath been.

<sup>20</sup> As to the beauty of his ornament, For excellency He set it, And the images of their abominations, Their detestable things — they made in it, Therefore I have given it to them for impurity,

<sup>21</sup> And I have given it into the hand of the strangers for a prey, And to the wicked of the land for a spoil, And they have polluted it.

<sup>22</sup> And I have turned My face from them, And they have polluted My hidden place, Yea, come into it have destroyers, and polluted it.

<sup>23</sup> Make the chain; for the land Hath been full of bloody judgments, And the city hath been full of violence.

<sup>24</sup> And I have brought in the wicked of the nations, And they have possessed their houses, And I have caused to cease the excellency of the strong, And polluted have been those sanctifying them.

<sup>25</sup> Destruction hath come, And they have sought peace, and there is none.

<sup>26</sup> Mischief on mischief cometh, and report is on report, And they have sought a vision from a prophet, And law doth perish from the priest, And counsel from the elders,

<sup>27</sup> The king doth become a mourner, And a prince putteth on desolation, And the hands of the people of the land are troubled, From their own way I deal with them, And with their own judgments I judge them, And they have known that I [am] Jehovah!'
