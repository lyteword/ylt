# Chapter 42

<sup>1</sup> And he bringeth me forth unto the outer court, the way northward, and he bringeth me in unto the chamber that [is] over-against the separate place, and that [is] over-against the building at the north.

<sup>2</sup> At the front of the length [is] a hundred cubits [at] the north opening, and the breadth fifty cubits.

<sup>3</sup> Over-against the twenty [cubits] that are to the inner court, and over-against the pavement that [is] to the outer court, [is] gallery over-against gallery, in the three [storeys].

<sup>4</sup> And at the front of the chambers [is] a walk of ten cubits in breadth unto the inner part, a way of one cubit, and their openings [are] at the north.

<sup>5</sup> And the upper chambers [are] short, for the galleries contain more than these, than the lower, and than the middle one, of the building;

<sup>6</sup> for they [are] threefold, and they have no pillars as the pillars of the court, therefore it hath been kept back — more than the lower and than the middle one — from the ground.

<sup>7</sup> As to the wall that [is] at the outside, over-against the chambers, the way of the outer-court at the front of the chambers, its length [is] fifty cubits;

<sup>8</sup> for the length of the chambers that [are] to the outer court [is] fifty cubits, and of those on the front of the temple a hundred cubits.

<sup>9</sup> And under these chambers [is] the entrance from the east, in one's going into them from the outer court.

<sup>10</sup> In the breadth of the wall of the court eastward, unto the front of the separate place, and unto the front of the building, [are] chambers.

<sup>11</sup> And the way before them [is] as the appearance of the chambers that [are] northward, according to their length so [is] their breadth, and all their outlets, and according to their fashions, and according to their openings.

<sup>12</sup> And according to the openings of the chambers that [are] southward [is] an opening at the head of the way, the way directly in the front of the wall eastward in entering them.

<sup>13</sup> And he saith unto me, 'The north chambers, the south chambers, that [are] at the front of the separate place, they [are] holy chambers, where the priests (who [are] near to Jehovah) eat the most holy things, there they place the most holy things, and the present, and the sin-offering, and the guilt-offering, for the place [is] holy.

<sup>14</sup> In the priests' going in, they come not out from the sanctuary unto the outer court, and there they place their garments with which they minister, for they [are] holy, and have put on other garments, and have drawn near unto that which [is] for the people.'

<sup>15</sup> And he hath finished the measurements of the inner house, and hath brought me forth the way of the gate whose front [is] eastward, and he hath measured it all round about.

<sup>16</sup> He hath measured the east side with the measuring-reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring-reed round about.

<sup>17</sup> He hath measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.

<sup>18</sup> The south side he hath measured, five hundred reeds, with the measuring-reed.

<sup>19</sup> He hath turned round unto the west side, he hath measured five hundred reeds with the measuring-reed.

<sup>20</sup> At the four sides he hath measured it, a wall [is] to it all round about, the length five hundred, and the breadth five hundred, to separate between the holy and the profane place.
