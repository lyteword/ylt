# Chapter 27

<sup>1</sup> And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying:

<sup>2</sup> 'And thou, son of man, lift up concerning Tyre a lamentation, and thou hast said to Tyre:

<sup>3</sup> O dweller on the entrances of the sea, Merchant of the peoples unto many isles, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: O Tyre, thou — thou hast said: I [am] the perfection of beauty.

<sup>4</sup> In the heart of the seas [are] thy borders, Thy builders have perfected thy beauty.

<sup>5</sup> Of firs of Senir they have built to thee all thy double-boarded ships, Of cedars of Lebanon they have taken to make a mast for thee,

<sup>6</sup> Of oaks of Bashan they made thine oars, Thy bench they have made of ivory, A branch of Ashurim from isles of Chittim.

<sup>7</sup> Of fine linen with embroidery from Egypt hath been thy sail, To be to thee for an ensign, Of blue and purple from isles of Elishah hath been thy covering.

<sup>8</sup> Inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad have been rowers to thee, Thy wise men, O Tyre, have been in thee, They [are] thy pilots.

<sup>9</sup> Elders of Gebal and its wise men have been in thee, Strengthening thy breach; All ships of the sea and their mariners, Have been in thee, to trade [with] thy merchandise.

<sup>10</sup> Persian and Lud and Phut Have been in thy forces — thy men of war. Shield and helmet they hung up in thee, They — they have given out thine honour.

<sup>11</sup> The sons of Arvad, and thy force, [Are] on thy walls round about, And short swordsmen in thy towers have been, Their shields they have hung up on thy walls round about, They — they have perfected thy beauty.

<sup>12</sup> Tarshish [is] thy merchant, Because of the abundance of all wealth, For silver, iron, tin, and lead, They have given out thy remnants.

<sup>13</sup> Javan, Tubal, and Meshech — they [are] thy merchants, For persons of men, and vessels of brass, They have given out thy merchandise.

<sup>14</sup> They of the house of Togarmah, [For] horses, and riding steeds, and mules, They have given out thy remnants.

<sup>15</sup> Sons of Dedan [are] thy merchants, Many isles [are] the mart of thy hand, Horns of ivory and ebony they sent back thy reward.

<sup>16</sup> Aram [is] thy merchant, Because of the abundance of thy works, For emerald, purple, and embroidery, And fine linen, and coral, and agate, They have given out thy remnants.

<sup>17</sup> Judah and the land of Israel — they [are] thy merchants, For wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, And honey, and oil, and balm, They have given out thy merchandise.

<sup>18</sup> Damascus [is] thy merchant, For the abundance of thy works, Because of the abundance of all wealth, For wine of Helbon, and white wool.

<sup>19</sup> Vedan and Javan go about with thy remnants, They have given shining iron, cassia, and cane, In thy merchandise it hath been.

<sup>20</sup> Dedan [is] thy merchant, For clothes of freedom for riding.

<sup>21</sup> Arabia, and all princes of Kedar, They [are] the traders of thy hand, For lambs, and rams, and he-goats, In these thy merchants.

<sup>22</sup> Merchants of Sheba and Raamah — they [are] thy merchants, For the chief of all spices, And for every precious stone, and gold, They have given out thy remnants.

<sup>23</sup> Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, merchants of Sheba, Asshur — Chilmad — [are] thy merchants,

<sup>24</sup> They [are] thy merchants for perfect things, For wrappings of blue, and embroidery, And for treasuries of rich apparel, With cords bound and girded, for thy merchandise,

<sup>25</sup> Ships of Tarshish [are] thy double walls of thy merchandise, And thou art filled and honoured greatly, In the heart of the seas.

<sup>26</sup> Into great waters have they brought thee, Those rowing thee, The east wind hath broken thee in the heart of the seas.

<sup>27</sup> Thy wealth and thy remnants, Thy merchandise, thy mariners, And thy pilots, strengtheners of thy breach, And the traders of thy merchandise, And all thy men of war, who [are] in thee, And in all thine assembly that [is] in thy midst, Fall into the heart of the seas in the day of thy fall,

<sup>28</sup> At the voice of the cry of thy pilots shake do the suburbs.

<sup>29</sup> And come down from their ships have all handling an oar, Mariners, all the pilots of the sea, on the land they stand,

<sup>30</sup> And have sounded for thee with their voice, And cry bitterly, and cause dust to go up on their heads, In ashes they do roll themselves.

<sup>31</sup> And they have made for thee baldness, And they have girded on sackcloth, And they have wept for thee, In bitterness of soul — a bitter mourning.

<sup>32</sup> And lifted up for thee have their sons a lamentation, And they have lamented over thee, who [is] as Tyre? As the cut-off one in the midst of the sea?

<sup>33</sup> With the outgoing of thy remnants from the seas, Thou hast filled many peoples, With the abundance of thy riches, and thy merchandise, Thou hast made rich things of earth.

<sup>34</sup> The time of [thy] being broken by the seas in the depths of the waters, Thy merchandise and all thy assembly in thy midst have fallen.

<sup>35</sup> All inhabitants of the isles have been astonished at thee, And their kings have been sore afraid, They have been troubled in countenance.

<sup>36</sup> Merchants among the peoples have shrieked for thee, Wastes thou hast been, and thou art not — to the age!'
