# Chapter 27

<sup>1</sup> And when our sailing to Italy was determined, they were delivering up both Paul and certain others, prisoners, to a centurion, by name Julius, of the band of Sebastus,

<sup>2</sup> and having embarked in a ship of Adramyttium, we, being about to sail by the coasts of Asia, did set sail, there being with us Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica,

<sup>3</sup> on the next [day] also we touched at Sidon, and Julius, courteously treating Paul, did permit [him], having gone on unto friends, to receive [their] care.

<sup>4</sup> And thence, having set sail, we sailed under Cyprus, because of the winds being contrary,

<sup>5</sup> and having sailed over the sea over-against Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myria of Lycia,

<sup>6</sup> and there the centurion having found a ship of Alexandria, sailing to Italy, did put us into it,

<sup>7</sup> and having sailed slowly many days, and with difficulty coming over-against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over-against Salmone,

<sup>8</sup> and hardly passing it, we came to a certain place called 'Fair Havens,' nigh to which was the city [of] Lasaea.

<sup>9</sup> And much time being spent, and the sailing being now dangerous — because of the fast also being already past — Paul was admonishing,

<sup>10</sup> saying to them, 'Men, I perceive that with hurt, and much damage, not only of the lading and of the ship, but also of our lives — the voyage is about to be;'

<sup>11</sup> but the centurion to the pilot and to the shipowner gave credence more than to the things spoken by Paul;

<sup>12</sup> and the haven being incommodious to winter in, the more part gave counsel to sail thence also, if by any means they might be able, having attained to Phenice, [there] to winter, [which is] a haven of Crete, looking to the south-west and north-west,

<sup>13</sup> and a south wind blowing softly, having thought they had obtained [their] purpose, having lifted anchor, they sailed close by Crete,

<sup>14</sup> and not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, that is called Euroclydon,

<sup>15</sup> and the ship being caught, and not being able to bear up against the wind, having given [her] up, we were borne on,

<sup>16</sup> and having run under a certain little isle, called Clauda, we were hardly able to become masters of the boat,

<sup>17</sup> which having taken up, they were using helps, undergirding the ship, and fearing lest they may fall on the quicksand, having let down the mast — so were borne on.

<sup>18</sup> And we, being exceedingly tempest-tossed, the succeeding [day] they were making a clearing,

<sup>19</sup> and on the third [day] with our own hands the tackling of the ship we cast out,

<sup>20</sup> and neither sun nor stars appearing for more days, and not a little tempest lying upon us, thenceforth all hope was taken away of our being saved.

<sup>21</sup> And there having been long fasting, then Paul having stood in the midst of them, said, 'It behoved [you], indeed, O men — having hearkened to me — not to set sail from Crete, and to save this hurt and damage;

<sup>22</sup> and now I exhort you to be of good cheer, for there shall be no loss of life among you — but of the ship;

<sup>23</sup> for there stood by me this night a messenger of God — whose I am, and whom I serve —

<sup>24</sup> saying, Be not afraid Paul; before Caesar it behoveth thee to stand; and, lo, God hath granted to thee all those sailing with thee;

<sup>25</sup> wherefore be of good cheer, men! for I believe God, that so it shall be, even as it hath been spoken to me,

<sup>26</sup> and on a certain island it behoveth us to be cast.'

<sup>27</sup> And when the fourteenth night came — we being borne up and down in the Adria — toward the middle of the night the sailors were supposing that some country drew nigh to them;

<sup>28</sup> and having sounded they found twenty fathoms, and having gone a little farther, and again having sounded, they found fifteen fathoms,

<sup>29</sup> and fearing lest on rough places we may fall, out of the stern having cast four anchors, they were wishing day to come.

<sup>30</sup> And the sailors seeking to flee out of the ship, and having let down the boat to the sea, in pretence as [if] out of the foreship they are about to cast anchors,

<sup>31</sup> Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, 'If these do not remain in the ship — ye are not able to be saved;'

<sup>32</sup> then the soldiers did cut off the ropes of the boat, and suffered it to fall off.

<sup>33</sup> And till the day was about to be, Paul was calling upon all to partake of nourishment, saying, 'Fourteen days to-day, waiting, ye continue fasting, having taken nothing,

<sup>34</sup> wherefore I call upon you to take nourishment, for this is for your safety, for of not one of you shall a hair from the head fall;'

<sup>35</sup> and having said these things, and having taken bread, he gave thanks to God before all, and having broken [it], he began to eat;

<sup>36</sup> and all having become of good cheer, themselves also took food,

<sup>37</sup> (and we were — all the souls in the ship — two hundred, seventy and six),

<sup>38</sup> and having eaten sufficient nourishment, they were lightening the ship, casting forth the wheat into the sea.

<sup>39</sup> And when the day came, they were not discerning the land, but a certain creek were perceiving having a beach, into which they took counsel, if possible, to thrust forward the ship,

<sup>40</sup> and the anchors having taken up, they were committing [it] to the sea, at the same time — having loosed the bands of the rudders, and having hoisted up the mainsail to the wind — they were making for the shore,

<sup>41</sup> and having fallen into a place of two seas, they ran the ship aground, and the fore-part, indeed, having stuck fast, did remain immoveable, but the hinder-part was broken by the violence of the waves.

<sup>42</sup> And the soldiers' counsel was that they should kill the prisoners, lest any one having swam out should escape,

<sup>43</sup> but the centurion, wishing to save Paul, hindered them from the counsel, and did command those able to swim, having cast themselves out first — to get unto the land,

<sup>44</sup> and the rest, some indeed upon boards, and some upon certain things of the ship; and thus it came to pass that all came safe unto the land.
