# Acts 11 

**¹** And the apostles and the brethren who are in Judea heard that also the nations did receive the word of God,

**²** and when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision were contending with him,

**³** saying — 'Unto men uncircumcised thou didst go in, and didst eat with them!'

**⁴** And Peter having begun, did expound to them in order saying,

**⁵** 'I was in the city of Joppa praying, and I saw in a trance a vision, a certain vessel coming down, as a great sheet by four corners being let down out of the heaven, and it came unto me;

**⁶** at which having looked stedfastly, I was considering, and I saw the four-footed beasts of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the fowls of heaven;

**⁷** and I heard a voice saying to me, Having risen, Peter, slay and eat;

**⁸** and I said, Not so, Lord; because anything common or unclean hath at no time entered into my mouth;

**⁹** and a voice did answer me a second time out of the heaven, What God did cleanse, thou — declare not thou common.

**¹⁰** 'And this happened thrice, and again was all drawn up to the heaven,

**¹¹** and, lo, immediately, three men stood at the house in which I was, having been sent from Caesarea unto me,

**¹²** and the Spirit said to me to go with them, nothing doubting, and these six brethren also went with me, and we did enter into the house of the man,

**¹³** he declared also to us how he saw the messenger in his house standing, and saying to him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter,

**¹⁴** who shall speak sayings by which thou shalt be saved, thou and all thy house.

**¹⁵** 'And in my beginning to speak, the Holy Spirit did fall upon them, even as also upon us in the beginning,

**¹⁶** and I remembered the saying of the Lord, how he said, John indeed did baptize with water, and ye shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit;

**¹⁷** if then the equal gift God did give to them as also to us, having believed upon the Lord Jesus Christ, I — how was I able to withstand God?'

**¹⁸** And they, having heard these things, were silent, and were glorifying God, saying, 'Then, indeed, also to the nations did God give the reformation to life.'

**¹⁹** Those, indeed, therefore, having been scattered abroad, from the tribulation that came after Stephen, went through unto Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none except to Jews only;

**²⁰** and there were certain of them men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who having entered into Antioch, were speaking unto the Hellenists, proclaiming good news — the Lord Jesus,

**²¹** and the hand of the Lord was with them, a great number also, having believed, did turn unto the Lord.

**²²** And the account was heard in the ears of the assembly that [is] in Jerusalem concerning them, and they sent forth Barnabas to go through unto Antioch,

**²³** who, having come, and having seen the grace of God, was glad, and was exhorting all with purpose of heart to cleave to the Lord,

**²⁴** because he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit, and of faith, and a great multitude was added to the Lord.

**²⁵** And Barnabas went forth to Tarsus, to seek for Saul,

**²⁶** and having found him, he brought him to Antioch, and it came to pass that they a whole year did assemble together in the assembly, and taught a great multitude, the disciples also were divinely called first in Antioch Christians.

**²⁷** And in those days there came from Jerusalem prophets to Antioch,

**²⁸** and one of them, by name Agabus, having stood up, did signify through the Spirit a great dearth is about to be throughout all the world — which also came to pass in the time of Claudius Caesar —

**²⁹** and the disciples, according as any one was prospering, determined each of them to send for ministration to the brethren dwelling in Judea,

**³⁰** which also they did, having sent unto the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.
