# Mark 15 

**¹** And immediately, in the morning, the chief priests having made a consultation, with the elders, and scribes, and the whole sanhedrim, having bound Jesus, did lead away, and delivered [him] to Pilate;

**²** and Pilate questioned him, 'Art thou the king of the Jews?' and he answering said to him, 'Thou dost say [it].'

**³** And the chief priests were accusing him of many things, [but he answered nothing.]

**⁴** And Pilate again questioned him, saying, 'Thou dost not answer anything! lo, how many things they do testify against thee!'

**⁵** and Jesus did no more answer anything, so that Pilate wondered.

**⁶** And at every feast he was releasing to them one prisoner, whomsoever they were asking;

**⁷** and there was [one] named Barabbas, bound with those making insurrection with him, who had in the insurrection committed murder.

**⁸** And the multitude having cried out, began to ask for themselves as he was always doing to them,

**⁹** and Pilate answered them, saying, 'Will ye [that] I shall release to you the king of the Jews?'

**¹⁰** for he knew that because of envy the chief priests had delivered him up;

**¹¹** and the chief priests did move the multitude, that he might rather release Barabbas to them.

**¹²** And Pilate answering, again said to them, 'What, then, will ye [that] I shall do to him whom ye call king of the Jews?'

**¹³** and they again cried out, 'Crucify him.'

**¹⁴** And Pilate said to them, 'Why — what evil did he?' and they cried out the more vehemently, 'Crucify him;'

**¹⁵** and Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released to them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus — having scourged [him] — that he might be crucified.

**¹⁶** And the soldiers led him away into the hall, which is Praetorium, and call together the whole band,

**¹⁷** and clothe him with purple, and having plaited a crown of thorns, they put [it] on him,

**¹⁸** and began to salute him, 'Hail, King of the Jews.'

**¹⁹** And they were smiting him on the head with a reed, and were spitting on him, and having bent the knee, were bowing to him,

**²⁰** and when they [had] mocked him, they took the purple from off him, and clothed him in his own garments, and they led him forth, that they may crucify him.

**²¹** And they impress a certain one passing by — Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the field, the father of Alexander and Rufus — that he may bear his cross,

**²²** and they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, 'Place of a skull;'

**²³** and they were giving him to drink wine mingled with myrrh, and he did not receive.

**²⁴** And having crucified him, they were dividing his garments, casting a lot upon them, what each may take;

**²⁵** and it was the third hour, and they crucified him;

**²⁶** and the inscription of his accusation was written above — 'The King of the Jews.'

**²⁷** And with him they crucify two robbers, one on the right hand, and one on his left,

**²⁸** and the Writing was fulfilled that is saying, 'And with lawless ones he was numbered.'

**²⁹** And those passing by were speaking evil of him, shaking their heads, and saying, 'Ah, the thrower down of the sanctuary, and in three days the builder!

**³⁰** save thyself, and come down from the cross!'

**³¹** And in like manner also the chief priests, mocking with one another, with the scribes, said, 'Others he saved; himself he is not able to save.

**³²** The Christ! the king of Israel — let him come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe;' and those crucified with him were reproaching him.

**³³** And the sixth hour having come, darkness came over the whole land till the ninth hour,

**³⁴** and at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a great voice, saying, 'Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabachthani?' which is, being interpreted, 'My God, my God, why didst Thou forsake me?'

**³⁵** And certain of those standing by, having heard, said, 'Lo, Elijah he doth call;'

**³⁶** and one having run, and having filled a spunge with vinegar, having put [it] also on a reed, was giving him to drink, saying, 'Let alone, let us see if Elijah doth come to take him down.'

**³⁷** And Jesus having uttered a loud cry, yielded the spirit,

**³⁸** and the veil of the sanctuary was rent in two, from top to bottom,

**³⁹** and the centurion who was standing over-against him, having seen that, having so cried out, he yielded the spirit, said, 'Truly this man was Son of God.'

**⁴⁰** And there were also women afar off beholding, among whom was also Mary the Magdalene, and Mary of James the less, and of Joses, and Salome,

**⁴¹** (who also, when he was in Galilee, were following him, and were ministering to him,) and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.

**⁴²** And now evening having come, seeing it was the preparation, that is, the fore-sabbath,

**⁴³** Joseph of Arimathea, an honourable counsellor, who also himself was waiting for the reign of God, came, boldly entered in unto Pilate, and asked the body of Jesus.

**⁴⁴** And Pilate wondered if he were already dead, and having called near the centurion, did question him if he were long dead,

**⁴⁵** and having known [it] from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.

**⁴⁶** And he, having brought fine linen, and having taken him down, wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre that had been hewn out of a rock, and he rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre,

**⁴⁷** and Mary the Magdalene, and Mary of Joses, were beholding where he is laid.
