# Chapter 15

<sup>1</sup> And immediately, in the morning, the chief priests having made a consultation, with the elders, and scribes, and the whole sanhedrim, having bound Jesus, did lead away, and delivered [him] to Pilate;

<sup>2</sup> and Pilate questioned him, 'Art thou the king of the Jews?' and he answering said to him, 'Thou dost say [it].'

<sup>3</sup> And the chief priests were accusing him of many things, [but he answered nothing.]

<sup>4</sup> And Pilate again questioned him, saying, 'Thou dost not answer anything! lo, how many things they do testify against thee!'

<sup>5</sup> and Jesus did no more answer anything, so that Pilate wondered.

<sup>6</sup> And at every feast he was releasing to them one prisoner, whomsoever they were asking;

<sup>7</sup> and there was [one] named Barabbas, bound with those making insurrection with him, who had in the insurrection committed murder.

<sup>8</sup> And the multitude having cried out, began to ask for themselves as he was always doing to them,

<sup>9</sup> and Pilate answered them, saying, 'Will ye [that] I shall release to you the king of the Jews?'

<sup>10</sup> for he knew that because of envy the chief priests had delivered him up;

<sup>11</sup> and the chief priests did move the multitude, that he might rather release Barabbas to them.

<sup>12</sup> And Pilate answering, again said to them, 'What, then, will ye [that] I shall do to him whom ye call king of the Jews?'

<sup>13</sup> and they again cried out, 'Crucify him.'

<sup>14</sup> And Pilate said to them, 'Why — what evil did he?' and they cried out the more vehemently, 'Crucify him;'

<sup>15</sup> and Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released to them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus — having scourged [him] — that he might be crucified.

<sup>16</sup> And the soldiers led him away into the hall, which is Praetorium, and call together the whole band,

<sup>17</sup> and clothe him with purple, and having plaited a crown of thorns, they put [it] on him,

<sup>18</sup> and began to salute him, 'Hail, King of the Jews.'

<sup>19</sup> And they were smiting him on the head with a reed, and were spitting on him, and having bent the knee, were bowing to him,

<sup>20</sup> and when they [had] mocked him, they took the purple from off him, and clothed him in his own garments, and they led him forth, that they may crucify him.

<sup>21</sup> And they impress a certain one passing by — Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the field, the father of Alexander and Rufus — that he may bear his cross,

<sup>22</sup> and they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, 'Place of a skull;'

<sup>23</sup> and they were giving him to drink wine mingled with myrrh, and he did not receive.

<sup>24</sup> And having crucified him, they were dividing his garments, casting a lot upon them, what each may take;

<sup>25</sup> and it was the third hour, and they crucified him;

<sup>26</sup> and the inscription of his accusation was written above — 'The King of the Jews.'

<sup>27</sup> And with him they crucify two robbers, one on the right hand, and one on his left,

<sup>28</sup> and the Writing was fulfilled that is saying, 'And with lawless ones he was numbered.'

<sup>29</sup> And those passing by were speaking evil of him, shaking their heads, and saying, 'Ah, the thrower down of the sanctuary, and in three days the builder!

<sup>30</sup> save thyself, and come down from the cross!'

<sup>31</sup> And in like manner also the chief priests, mocking with one another, with the scribes, said, 'Others he saved; himself he is not able to save.

<sup>32</sup> The Christ! the king of Israel — let him come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe;' and those crucified with him were reproaching him.

<sup>33</sup> And the sixth hour having come, darkness came over the whole land till the ninth hour,

<sup>34</sup> and at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a great voice, saying, 'Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabachthani?' which is, being interpreted, 'My God, my God, why didst Thou forsake me?'

<sup>35</sup> And certain of those standing by, having heard, said, 'Lo, Elijah he doth call;'

<sup>36</sup> and one having run, and having filled a spunge with vinegar, having put [it] also on a reed, was giving him to drink, saying, 'Let alone, let us see if Elijah doth come to take him down.'

<sup>37</sup> And Jesus having uttered a loud cry, yielded the spirit,

<sup>38</sup> and the veil of the sanctuary was rent in two, from top to bottom,

<sup>39</sup> and the centurion who was standing over-against him, having seen that, having so cried out, he yielded the spirit, said, 'Truly this man was Son of God.'

<sup>40</sup> And there were also women afar off beholding, among whom was also Mary the Magdalene, and Mary of James the less, and of Joses, and Salome,

<sup>41</sup> (who also, when he was in Galilee, were following him, and were ministering to him,) and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.

<sup>42</sup> And now evening having come, seeing it was the preparation, that is, the fore-sabbath,

<sup>43</sup> Joseph of Arimathea, an honourable counsellor, who also himself was waiting for the reign of God, came, boldly entered in unto Pilate, and asked the body of Jesus.

<sup>44</sup> And Pilate wondered if he were already dead, and having called near the centurion, did question him if he were long dead,

<sup>45</sup> and having known [it] from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.

<sup>46</sup> And he, having brought fine linen, and having taken him down, wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre that had been hewn out of a rock, and he rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre,

<sup>47</sup> and Mary the Magdalene, and Mary of Joses, were beholding where he is laid.
