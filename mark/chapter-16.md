# Chapter 16

<sup>1</sup> And the sabbath having past, Mary the Magdalene, and Mary of James, and Salome, bought spices, that having come, they may anoint him,

<sup>2</sup> and early in the morning of the first of the sabbaths, they come unto the sepulchre, at the rising of the sun,

<sup>3</sup> and they said among themselves, 'Who shall roll away for us the stone out of the door of the sepulchre?'

<sup>4</sup> And having looked, they see that the stone hath been rolled away — for it was very great,

<sup>5</sup> and having entered into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right hand, arrayed in a long white robe, and they were amazed.

<sup>6</sup> And he saith to them, 'Be not amazed, ye seek Jesus the Nazarene, the crucified: he did rise — he is not here; lo, the place where they laid him!

<sup>7</sup> and go, say to his disciples, and Peter, that he doth go before you to Galilee; there ye shall see him, as he said to you.'

<sup>8</sup> And, having come forth quickly, they fled from the sepulchre, and trembling and amazement had seized them, and to no one said they anything, for they were afraid.

<sup>9</sup> And he, having risen in the morning of the first of the sabbaths, did appear first to Mary the Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven demons;

<sup>10</sup> she having gone, told those who had been with him, mourning and weeping;

<sup>11</sup> and they, having heard that he is alive, and was seen by her, did not believe.

<sup>12</sup> And after these things, to two of them, as they are going into a field, walking, he was manifested in another form,

<sup>13</sup> and they having gone, told to the rest; not even them did they believe.

<sup>14</sup> Afterwards, as they are reclining (at meat), he was manifested to the eleven, and did reproach their unbelief and stiffness of heart, because they believed not those having seen him being raised;

<sup>15</sup> and he said to them, 'Having gone to all the world, proclaim the good news to all the creation;

<sup>16</sup> he who hath believed, and hath been baptized, shall be saved; and he who hath not believed, shall be condemned.

<sup>17</sup> 'And signs shall accompany those believing these things; in my name demons they shall cast out; with new tongues they shall speak;

<sup>18</sup> serpents they shall take up; and if any deadly thing they may drink, it shall not hurt them; on the ailing they shall lay hands, and they shall be well.'

<sup>19</sup> The Lord, then, indeed, after speaking to them, was received up to the heaven, and sat on the right hand of God;

<sup>20</sup> and they, having gone forth, did preach everywhere, the Lord working with [them], and confirming the word, through the signs following. Amen.
