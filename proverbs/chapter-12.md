# Proverbs 12 

**¹** Whoso is loving instruction, is loving knowledge, And whoso is hating reproof [is] brutish.

**²** The good bringeth forth favour from Jehovah, And the man of wicked devices He condemneth.

**³** A man is not established by wickedness, And the root of the righteous is not moved.

**⁴** A virtuous woman [is] a crown to her husband, And as rottenness in his bones [is] one causing shame.

**⁵** The thoughts of the righteous [are] justice, The counsels of the wicked — deceit.

**⁶** The words of the wicked [are]: 'Lay wait for blood,' And the mouth of the upright delivereth them.

**⁷** Overthrow the wicked, and they are not, And the house of the righteous standeth.

**⁸** According to his wisdom is a man praised, And the perverted of heart becometh despised.

**⁹** Better [is] the lightly esteemed who hath a servant, Than the self-honoured who lacketh bread.

**¹⁰** The righteous knoweth the life of his beast, And the mercies of the wicked [are] cruel.

**¹¹** Whoso is tilling the ground is satisfied [with] bread, And whoso is pursuing vanities is lacking heart,

**¹²** The wicked hath desired the net of evil doers, And the root of the righteous giveth.

**¹³** In transgression of the lips [is] the snare of the wicked, And the righteous goeth out from distress.

**¹⁴** From the fruit of the mouth [is] one satisfied [with] good, And the deed of man's hands returneth to him.

**¹⁵** The way of a fool [is] right in his own eyes, And whoso is hearkening to counsel [is] wise.

**¹⁶** The fool — in a day is his anger known, And the prudent is covering shame.

**¹⁷** Whoso uttereth faithfulness declareth righteousness, And a false witness — deceit.

**¹⁸** A rash speaker is like piercings of a sword, And the tongue of the wise is healing.

**¹⁹** The lip of truth is established for ever, And for a moment — a tongue of falsehood.

**²⁰** Deceit [is] in the heart of those devising evil, And to those counselling peace [is] joy.

**²¹** No iniquity is desired by the righteous, And the wicked have been full of evil.

**²²** An abomination to Jehovah [are] lying lips, And stedfast doers [are] his delight.

**²³** A prudent man is concealing knowledge, And the heart of fools proclaimeth folly.

**²⁴** The hand of the diligent ruleth, And slothfulness becometh tributary.

**²⁵** Sorrow in the heart of a man boweth down, And a good word maketh him glad.

**²⁶** The righteous searcheth his companion, And the way of the wicked causeth them to err.

**²⁷** The slothful roasteth not his hunting, And the wealth of a diligent man is precious.

**²⁸** In the path of righteousness [is] life, And in the way of [that] path [is] no death!
