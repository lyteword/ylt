# Chapter 12

<sup>1</sup> Whoso is loving instruction, is loving knowledge, And whoso is hating reproof [is] brutish.

<sup>2</sup> The good bringeth forth favour from Jehovah, And the man of wicked devices He condemneth.

<sup>3</sup> A man is not established by wickedness, And the root of the righteous is not moved.

<sup>4</sup> A virtuous woman [is] a crown to her husband, And as rottenness in his bones [is] one causing shame.

<sup>5</sup> The thoughts of the righteous [are] justice, The counsels of the wicked — deceit.

<sup>6</sup> The words of the wicked [are]: 'Lay wait for blood,' And the mouth of the upright delivereth them.

<sup>7</sup> Overthrow the wicked, and they are not, And the house of the righteous standeth.

<sup>8</sup> According to his wisdom is a man praised, And the perverted of heart becometh despised.

<sup>9</sup> Better [is] the lightly esteemed who hath a servant, Than the self-honoured who lacketh bread.

<sup>10</sup> The righteous knoweth the life of his beast, And the mercies of the wicked [are] cruel.

<sup>11</sup> Whoso is tilling the ground is satisfied [with] bread, And whoso is pursuing vanities is lacking heart,

<sup>12</sup> The wicked hath desired the net of evil doers, And the root of the righteous giveth.

<sup>13</sup> In transgression of the lips [is] the snare of the wicked, And the righteous goeth out from distress.

<sup>14</sup> From the fruit of the mouth [is] one satisfied [with] good, And the deed of man's hands returneth to him.

<sup>15</sup> The way of a fool [is] right in his own eyes, And whoso is hearkening to counsel [is] wise.

<sup>16</sup> The fool — in a day is his anger known, And the prudent is covering shame.

<sup>17</sup> Whoso uttereth faithfulness declareth righteousness, And a false witness — deceit.

<sup>18</sup> A rash speaker is like piercings of a sword, And the tongue of the wise is healing.

<sup>19</sup> The lip of truth is established for ever, And for a moment — a tongue of falsehood.

<sup>20</sup> Deceit [is] in the heart of those devising evil, And to those counselling peace [is] joy.

<sup>21</sup> No iniquity is desired by the righteous, And the wicked have been full of evil.

<sup>22</sup> An abomination to Jehovah [are] lying lips, And stedfast doers [are] his delight.

<sup>23</sup> A prudent man is concealing knowledge, And the heart of fools proclaimeth folly.

<sup>24</sup> The hand of the diligent ruleth, And slothfulness becometh tributary.

<sup>25</sup> Sorrow in the heart of a man boweth down, And a good word maketh him glad.

<sup>26</sup> The righteous searcheth his companion, And the way of the wicked causeth them to err.

<sup>27</sup> The slothful roasteth not his hunting, And the wealth of a diligent man is precious.

<sup>28</sup> In the path of righteousness [is] life, And in the way of [that] path [is] no death!
