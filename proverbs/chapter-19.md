# Proverbs 19 

**¹** Better [is] the poor walking in his integrity, Than the perverse [in] his lips, who [is] a fool.

**²** Also, without knowledge the soul [is] not good, And the hasty in feet is sinning.

**³** The folly of man perverteth his way, And against Jehovah is his heart wroth.

**⁴** Wealth addeth many friends, And the poor from his neighbour is separated.

**⁵** A false witness is not acquitted, Whoso breatheth out lies is not delivered.

**⁶** Many entreat the face of the noble, And all have made friendship to a man of gifts.

**⁷** All the brethren of the poor have hated him, Surely also his friends have been far from him, He is pursuing words — they are not!

**⁸** Whoso is getting heart is loving his soul, He is keeping understanding to find good.

**⁹** A false witness is not acquitted, And whoso breatheth out lies perisheth.

**¹⁰** Luxury is not comely for a fool, Much less for a servant to rule among princes.

**¹¹** The wisdom of a man hath deferred his anger, And his glory [is] to pass over transgression.

**¹²** The wrath of a king [is] a growl as of a young lion, And as dew on the herb his good-will.

**¹³** A calamity to his father [is] a foolish son, And the contentions of a wife [are] a continual dropping.

**¹⁴** House and wealth [are] the inheritance of fathers, And from Jehovah [is] an understanding wife.

**¹⁵** Sloth causeth deep sleep to fall, And an indolent soul doth hunger.

**¹⁶** Whoso is keeping the command is keeping his soul, Whoso is despising His ways dieth.

**¹⁷** Whoso is lending [to] Jehovah is favouring the poor, And his deed He repayeth to him.

**¹⁸** Chastise thy son, for there is hope, And to put him to death lift not up thy soul.

**¹⁹** A man of great wrath is bearing punishment, For, if thou dost deliver, yet again thou dost add.

**²⁰** Hear counsel and receive instruction, So that thou art wise in thy latter end.

**²¹** Many [are] the purposes in a man's heart, And the counsel of Jehovah it standeth.

**²²** The desirableness of a man [is] his kindness, And better [is] the poor than a liar.

**²³** The fear of Jehovah [is] to life, And satisfied he remaineth — he is not charged with evil.

**²⁴** The slothful hath hidden his hand in a dish, Even unto his mouth he bringeth it not back.

**²⁵** A scorner smite, and the simple acts prudently, And give reproof to the intelligent, He understandeth knowledge.

**²⁶** Whoso is spoiling a father causeth a mother to flee, A son causing shame, and bringing confusion.

**²⁷** Cease, my son, to hear instruction — To err from sayings of knowledge.

**²⁸** A worthless witness scorneth judgment, And the mouth of the wicked swalloweth iniquity.

**²⁹** Judgments have been prepared for scorners, And stripes for the back of fools!
