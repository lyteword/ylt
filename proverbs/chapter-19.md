# Chapter 19

<sup>1</sup> Better [is] the poor walking in his integrity, Than the perverse [in] his lips, who [is] a fool.

<sup>2</sup> Also, without knowledge the soul [is] not good, And the hasty in feet is sinning.

<sup>3</sup> The folly of man perverteth his way, And against Jehovah is his heart wroth.

<sup>4</sup> Wealth addeth many friends, And the poor from his neighbour is separated.

<sup>5</sup> A false witness is not acquitted, Whoso breatheth out lies is not delivered.

<sup>6</sup> Many entreat the face of the noble, And all have made friendship to a man of gifts.

<sup>7</sup> All the brethren of the poor have hated him, Surely also his friends have been far from him, He is pursuing words — they are not!

<sup>8</sup> Whoso is getting heart is loving his soul, He is keeping understanding to find good.

<sup>9</sup> A false witness is not acquitted, And whoso breatheth out lies perisheth.

<sup>10</sup> Luxury is not comely for a fool, Much less for a servant to rule among princes.

<sup>11</sup> The wisdom of a man hath deferred his anger, And his glory [is] to pass over transgression.

<sup>12</sup> The wrath of a king [is] a growl as of a young lion, And as dew on the herb his good-will.

<sup>13</sup> A calamity to his father [is] a foolish son, And the contentions of a wife [are] a continual dropping.

<sup>14</sup> House and wealth [are] the inheritance of fathers, And from Jehovah [is] an understanding wife.

<sup>15</sup> Sloth causeth deep sleep to fall, And an indolent soul doth hunger.

<sup>16</sup> Whoso is keeping the command is keeping his soul, Whoso is despising His ways dieth.

<sup>17</sup> Whoso is lending [to] Jehovah is favouring the poor, And his deed He repayeth to him.

<sup>18</sup> Chastise thy son, for there is hope, And to put him to death lift not up thy soul.

<sup>19</sup> A man of great wrath is bearing punishment, For, if thou dost deliver, yet again thou dost add.

<sup>20</sup> Hear counsel and receive instruction, So that thou art wise in thy latter end.

<sup>21</sup> Many [are] the purposes in a man's heart, And the counsel of Jehovah it standeth.

<sup>22</sup> The desirableness of a man [is] his kindness, And better [is] the poor than a liar.

<sup>23</sup> The fear of Jehovah [is] to life, And satisfied he remaineth — he is not charged with evil.

<sup>24</sup> The slothful hath hidden his hand in a dish, Even unto his mouth he bringeth it not back.

<sup>25</sup> A scorner smite, and the simple acts prudently, And give reproof to the intelligent, He understandeth knowledge.

<sup>26</sup> Whoso is spoiling a father causeth a mother to flee, A son causing shame, and bringing confusion.

<sup>27</sup> Cease, my son, to hear instruction — To err from sayings of knowledge.

<sup>28</sup> A worthless witness scorneth judgment, And the mouth of the wicked swalloweth iniquity.

<sup>29</sup> Judgments have been prepared for scorners, And stripes for the back of fools!
