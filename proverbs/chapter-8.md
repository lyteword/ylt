# Proverbs 8 

**¹** Doth not wisdom call? And understanding give forth her voice?

**²** At the head of high places by the way, Between the paths she hath stood,

**³** At the side of the gates, at the mouth of the city, The entrance of the openings, she crieth aloud,

**⁴** 'Unto you, O men, I call, And my voice [is] unto the sons of men.

**⁵** Understand, ye simple ones, prudence, And ye fools, understand the heart,

**⁶** Hearken, for noble things I speak, And the opening of my lips [is] uprightness.

**⁷** For truth doth my mouth utter, And an abomination to my lips [is] wickedness.

**⁸** In righteousness [are] all the sayings of my mouth, Nothing in them is froward and perverse.

**⁹** All of them [are] plain to the intelligent, And upright to those finding knowledge.

**¹⁰** Receive my instruction, and not silver, And knowledge rather than choice gold.

**¹¹** For better [is] wisdom than rubies, Yea, all delights are not comparable with it.

**¹²** I, wisdom, have dwelt with prudence, And a knowledge of devices I find out.

**¹³** The fear of Jehovah [is] to hate evil; Pride, and arrogance, and an evil way, And a froward mouth, I have hated.

**¹⁴** Mine [is] counsel and substance, I [am] understanding, I have might.

**¹⁵** By me kings reign, and princes decree righteousness,

**¹⁶** By me do chiefs rule, and nobles, All judges of the earth.

**¹⁷** I love those loving me, And those seeking me earnestly do find me.

**¹⁸** Wealth and honour [are] with me, Lasting substance and righteousness.

**¹⁹** Better [is] my fruit than gold, even fine gold, And mine increase than choice silver.

**²⁰** In a path of righteousness I cause to walk, In midst of paths of judgment,

**²¹** To cause my lovers to inherit substance, Yea, their treasures I fill.

**²²** Jehovah possessed me — the beginning of His way, Before His works since then.

**²³** From the age I was anointed, from the first, From former states of the earth.

**²⁴** In there being no depths, I was brought forth, In there being no fountains heavy [with] waters,

**²⁵** Before mountains were sunk, Before heights, I was brought forth.

**²⁶** While He had not made the earth, and out-places, And the top of the dusts of the world.

**²⁷** In His preparing the heavens I [am] there, In His decreeing a circle on the face of the deep,

**²⁸** In His strengthening clouds above, In His making strong fountains of the deep,

**²⁹** In His setting for the sea its limit, And the waters transgress not His command, In His decreeing the foundations of earth,

**³⁰** Then I am near Him, a workman, And I am a delight — day by day. Rejoicing before Him at all times,

**³¹** Rejoicing in the habitable part of His earth, And my delights [are] with the sons of men.

**³²** And now, ye sons, hearken to me, Yea, happy are they who keep my ways.

**³³** Hear instruction, and be wise, and slight not.

**³⁴** O the happiness of the man hearkening to me, To watch at my doors day by day, To watch at the door-posts of my entrance.

**³⁵** For whoso is finding me, hath found life, And bringeth out good-will from Jehovah.

**³⁶** And whoso is missing me, is wronging his soul, All hating me have loved death!
