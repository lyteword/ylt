# Chapter 8

<sup>1</sup> Doth not wisdom call? And understanding give forth her voice?

<sup>2</sup> At the head of high places by the way, Between the paths she hath stood,

<sup>3</sup> At the side of the gates, at the mouth of the city, The entrance of the openings, she crieth aloud,

<sup>4</sup> 'Unto you, O men, I call, And my voice [is] unto the sons of men.

<sup>5</sup> Understand, ye simple ones, prudence, And ye fools, understand the heart,

<sup>6</sup> Hearken, for noble things I speak, And the opening of my lips [is] uprightness.

<sup>7</sup> For truth doth my mouth utter, And an abomination to my lips [is] wickedness.

<sup>8</sup> In righteousness [are] all the sayings of my mouth, Nothing in them is froward and perverse.

<sup>9</sup> All of them [are] plain to the intelligent, And upright to those finding knowledge.

<sup>10</sup> Receive my instruction, and not silver, And knowledge rather than choice gold.

<sup>11</sup> For better [is] wisdom than rubies, Yea, all delights are not comparable with it.

<sup>12</sup> I, wisdom, have dwelt with prudence, And a knowledge of devices I find out.

<sup>13</sup> The fear of Jehovah [is] to hate evil; Pride, and arrogance, and an evil way, And a froward mouth, I have hated.

<sup>14</sup> Mine [is] counsel and substance, I [am] understanding, I have might.

<sup>15</sup> By me kings reign, and princes decree righteousness,

<sup>16</sup> By me do chiefs rule, and nobles, All judges of the earth.

<sup>17</sup> I love those loving me, And those seeking me earnestly do find me.

<sup>18</sup> Wealth and honour [are] with me, Lasting substance and righteousness.

<sup>19</sup> Better [is] my fruit than gold, even fine gold, And mine increase than choice silver.

<sup>20</sup> In a path of righteousness I cause to walk, In midst of paths of judgment,

<sup>21</sup> To cause my lovers to inherit substance, Yea, their treasures I fill.

<sup>22</sup> Jehovah possessed me — the beginning of His way, Before His works since then.

<sup>23</sup> From the age I was anointed, from the first, From former states of the earth.

<sup>24</sup> In there being no depths, I was brought forth, In there being no fountains heavy [with] waters,

<sup>25</sup> Before mountains were sunk, Before heights, I was brought forth.

<sup>26</sup> While He had not made the earth, and out-places, And the top of the dusts of the world.

<sup>27</sup> In His preparing the heavens I [am] there, In His decreeing a circle on the face of the deep,

<sup>28</sup> In His strengthening clouds above, In His making strong fountains of the deep,

<sup>29</sup> In His setting for the sea its limit, And the waters transgress not His command, In His decreeing the foundations of earth,

<sup>30</sup> Then I am near Him, a workman, And I am a delight — day by day. Rejoicing before Him at all times,

<sup>31</sup> Rejoicing in the habitable part of His earth, And my delights [are] with the sons of men.

<sup>32</sup> And now, ye sons, hearken to me, Yea, happy are they who keep my ways.

<sup>33</sup> Hear instruction, and be wise, and slight not.

<sup>34</sup> O the happiness of the man hearkening to me, To watch at my doors day by day, To watch at the door-posts of my entrance.

<sup>35</sup> For whoso is finding me, hath found life, And bringeth out good-will from Jehovah.

<sup>36</sup> And whoso is missing me, is wronging his soul, All hating me have loved death!
