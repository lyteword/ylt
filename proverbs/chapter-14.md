# Chapter 14

<sup>1</sup> Every wise woman hath builded her house, And the foolish with her hands breaketh it down.

<sup>2</sup> Whoso is walking in his uprightness is fearing Jehovah, And the perverted [in] his ways is despising Him.

<sup>3</sup> In the mouth of a fool [is] a rod of pride, And the lips of the wise preserve them.

<sup>4</sup> Without oxen a stall [is] clean, And great [is] the increase by the power of the ox.

<sup>5</sup> A faithful witness lieth not, And a false witness breatheth out lies.

<sup>6</sup> A scorner hath sought wisdom, and it is not, And knowledge to the intelligent [is] easy.

<sup>7</sup> Go from before a foolish man, Or thou hast not known the lips of knowledge.

<sup>8</sup> The wisdom of the prudent [is] to understand his way, And the folly of fools [is] deceit.

<sup>9</sup> Fools mock at a guilt-offering, And among the upright — a pleasing thing.

<sup>10</sup> The heart knoweth its own bitterness, And with its joy a stranger doth not intermeddle.

<sup>11</sup> The house of the wicked is destroyed, And the tent of the upright flourisheth.

<sup>12</sup> There is a way — right before a man, And its latter end [are] ways of death.

<sup>13</sup> Even in laughter is the heart pained, And the latter end of joy [is] affliction.

<sup>14</sup> From his ways is the backslider in heart filled, And a good man — from his fruits.

<sup>15</sup> The simple giveth credence to everything, And the prudent attendeth to his step.

<sup>16</sup> The wise is fearing and turning from evil, And a fool is transgressing and is confident.

<sup>17</sup> Whoso is short of temper doth folly, And a man of wicked devices is hated.

<sup>18</sup> The simple have inherited folly, And the prudent are crowned [with] knowledge.

<sup>19</sup> The evil have bowed down before the good, And the wicked at the gates of the righteous.

<sup>20</sup> Even of his neighbour is the poor hated, And those loving the rich [are] many.

<sup>21</sup> Whoso is despising his neighbour sinneth, Whoso is favouring the humble, O his happiness.

<sup>22</sup> Do not they err who are devising evil? And kindness and truth [are] to those devising good,

<sup>23</sup> In all labour there is advantage, And a thing of the lips [is] only to want.

<sup>24</sup> The crown of the wise is their wealth, The folly of fools [is] folly.

<sup>25</sup> A true witness is delivering souls, And a deceitful one breatheth out lies.

<sup>26</sup> In the fear of Jehovah [is] strong confidence, And to His sons there is a refuge.

<sup>27</sup> The fear of Jehovah [is] a fountain of life, To turn aside from snares of death.

<sup>28</sup> In the multitude of a people [is] the honour of a king, And in lack of people the ruin of a prince.

<sup>29</sup> Whoso is slow to anger [is] of great understanding, And whoso is short in temper is exalting folly.

<sup>30</sup> A healed heart [is] life to the flesh, And rottenness to the bones [is] envy.

<sup>31</sup> An oppressor of the poor reproacheth his Maker, And whoso is honouring Him Is favouring the needy.

<sup>32</sup> In his wickedness is the wicked driven away, And trustful in his death [is] the righteous.

<sup>33</sup> In the heart of the intelligent wisdom doth rest. And in the midst of fools it is known.

<sup>34</sup> Righteousness exalteth a nation, And the goodliness of peoples [is] a sin-offering.

<sup>35</sup> The favour of a king [is] to a wise servant, And an object of his wrath is one causing shame!
