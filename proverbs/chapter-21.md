# Proverbs 21 

**¹** Rivulets of waters [is] the heart of a king in the hand of Jehovah, Wherever He pleaseth He inclineth it.

**²** Every way of a man [is] right in his own eyes, And Jehovah is pondering hearts.

**³** To do righteousness and judgment, Is chosen of Jehovah rather than sacrifice.

**⁴** Loftiness of eyes, and breadth of heart, Tillage of the wicked [is] sin.

**⁵** The purposes of the diligent [are] only to advantage, And of every hasty one, only to want.

**⁶** The making of treasures by a lying tongue, [Is] a vanity driven away of those seeking death.

**⁷** The spoil of the wicked catcheth them, Because they have refused to do judgment.

**⁸** Froward [is] the way of a man who is vile, And the pure — upright [is] his work.

**⁹** Better to sit on a corner of the roof, Than [with] a woman of contentions and a house of company.

**¹⁰** The soul of the wicked hath desired evil, Not gracious in his eyes is his neighbour.

**¹¹** When the scorner is punished, the simple becometh wise, And in giving understanding to the wise He receiveth knowledge.

**¹²** The Righteous One is acting wisely Towards the house of the wicked, He is overthrowing the wicked for wickedness.

**¹³** Whoso is shutting his ear from the cry of the poor, He also doth cry, and is not answered.

**¹⁴** A gift in secret pacifieth anger, And a bribe in the bosom strong fury.

**¹⁵** To do justice [is] joy to the righteous, But ruin to workers of iniquity.

**¹⁶** A man who is wandering from the way of understanding, In an assembly of Rephaim resteth.

**¹⁷** Whoso [is] loving mirth [is] a poor man, Whoso is loving wine and oil maketh no wealth.

**¹⁸** The wicked [is] an atonement for the righteous, And for the upright the treacherous dealer.

**¹⁹** Better to dwell in a wilderness land, Than [with] a woman of contentions and anger.

**²⁰** A treasure to be desired, and oil, [Is] in the habitation of the wise, And a foolish man swalloweth it up.

**²¹** Whoso is pursuing righteousness and kindness, Findeth life, righteousness, and honour.

**²²** A city of the mighty hath the wise gone up, And bringeth down the strength of its confidence.

**²³** Whoso is keeping his mouth and his tongue, Is keeping from adversities his soul.

**²⁴** Proud, haughty, scorner [is] his name, Who is working in the wrath of pride.

**²⁵** The desire of the slothful slayeth him, For his hands have refused to work.

**²⁶** All the day desiring he hath desired, And the righteous giveth and withholdeth not.

**²⁷** The sacrifice of the wicked [is] abomination, Much more when in wickedness he bringeth it.

**²⁸** A false witness doth perish, And an attentive man for ever speaketh.

**²⁹** A wicked man hath hardened by his face, And the upright — he prepareth his way.

**³⁰** There is no wisdom, nor understanding, Nor counsel, over-against Jehovah.

**³¹** A horse is prepared for a day of battle, And the deliverance [is] of Jehovah!
