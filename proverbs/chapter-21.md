# Chapter 21

<sup>1</sup> Rivulets of waters [is] the heart of a king in the hand of Jehovah, Wherever He pleaseth He inclineth it.

<sup>2</sup> Every way of a man [is] right in his own eyes, And Jehovah is pondering hearts.

<sup>3</sup> To do righteousness and judgment, Is chosen of Jehovah rather than sacrifice.

<sup>4</sup> Loftiness of eyes, and breadth of heart, Tillage of the wicked [is] sin.

<sup>5</sup> The purposes of the diligent [are] only to advantage, And of every hasty one, only to want.

<sup>6</sup> The making of treasures by a lying tongue, [Is] a vanity driven away of those seeking death.

<sup>7</sup> The spoil of the wicked catcheth them, Because they have refused to do judgment.

<sup>8</sup> Froward [is] the way of a man who is vile, And the pure — upright [is] his work.

<sup>9</sup> Better to sit on a corner of the roof, Than [with] a woman of contentions and a house of company.

<sup>10</sup> The soul of the wicked hath desired evil, Not gracious in his eyes is his neighbour.

<sup>11</sup> When the scorner is punished, the simple becometh wise, And in giving understanding to the wise He receiveth knowledge.

<sup>12</sup> The Righteous One is acting wisely Towards the house of the wicked, He is overthrowing the wicked for wickedness.

<sup>13</sup> Whoso is shutting his ear from the cry of the poor, He also doth cry, and is not answered.

<sup>14</sup> A gift in secret pacifieth anger, And a bribe in the bosom strong fury.

<sup>15</sup> To do justice [is] joy to the righteous, But ruin to workers of iniquity.

<sup>16</sup> A man who is wandering from the way of understanding, In an assembly of Rephaim resteth.

<sup>17</sup> Whoso [is] loving mirth [is] a poor man, Whoso is loving wine and oil maketh no wealth.

<sup>18</sup> The wicked [is] an atonement for the righteous, And for the upright the treacherous dealer.

<sup>19</sup> Better to dwell in a wilderness land, Than [with] a woman of contentions and anger.

<sup>20</sup> A treasure to be desired, and oil, [Is] in the habitation of the wise, And a foolish man swalloweth it up.

<sup>21</sup> Whoso is pursuing righteousness and kindness, Findeth life, righteousness, and honour.

<sup>22</sup> A city of the mighty hath the wise gone up, And bringeth down the strength of its confidence.

<sup>23</sup> Whoso is keeping his mouth and his tongue, Is keeping from adversities his soul.

<sup>24</sup> Proud, haughty, scorner [is] his name, Who is working in the wrath of pride.

<sup>25</sup> The desire of the slothful slayeth him, For his hands have refused to work.

<sup>26</sup> All the day desiring he hath desired, And the righteous giveth and withholdeth not.

<sup>27</sup> The sacrifice of the wicked [is] abomination, Much more when in wickedness he bringeth it.

<sup>28</sup> A false witness doth perish, And an attentive man for ever speaketh.

<sup>29</sup> A wicked man hath hardened by his face, And the upright — he prepareth his way.

<sup>30</sup> There is no wisdom, nor understanding, Nor counsel, over-against Jehovah.

<sup>31</sup> A horse is prepared for a day of battle, And the deliverance [is] of Jehovah!
