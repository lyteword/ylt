# Chapter 27

<sup>1</sup> Boast not thyself of to-morrow, For thou knowest not what a day bringeth forth.

<sup>2</sup> Let another praise thee, and not thine own mouth, A stranger, and not thine own lips.

<sup>3</sup> A stone [is] heavy, and the sand [is] heavy, And the anger of a fool Is heavier than they both.

<sup>4</sup> Fury [is] fierce, and anger [is] overflowing, And who standeth before jealousy?

<sup>5</sup> Better [is] open reproof than hidden love.

<sup>6</sup> Faithful are the wounds of a lover, And abundant the kisses of an enemy.

<sup>7</sup> A satiated soul treadeth down a honeycomb, And [to] a hungry soul every bitter thing [is] sweet.

<sup>8</sup> As a bird wandering from her nest, So [is] a man wandering from his place.

<sup>9</sup> Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart, And the sweetness of one's friend — from counsel of the soul.

<sup>10</sup> Thine own friend, and the friend of thy father, forsake not, And the house of thy brother enter not In a day of thy calamity, Better [is] a near neighbour than a brother afar off.

<sup>11</sup> Be wise, my son, and rejoice my heart. And I return my reproacher a word.

<sup>12</sup> The prudent hath seen the evil, he is hidden, The simple have passed on, they are punished.

<sup>13</sup> Take his garment, when a stranger hath been surety, And for a strange woman pledge it.

<sup>14</sup> Whoso is saluting his friend with a loud voice, In the morning rising early, A light thing it is reckoned to him.

<sup>15</sup> A continual dropping in a day of rain, And a woman of contentions are alike,

<sup>16</sup> Whoso is hiding her hath hidden the wind, And the ointment of his right hand calleth out.

<sup>17</sup> Iron by iron is sharpened, And a man sharpens the face of his friend.

<sup>18</sup> The keeper of a fig-tree eateth its fruit, And the preserver of his master is honoured.

<sup>19</sup> As [in] water the face [is] to face, So the heart of man to man.

<sup>20</sup> Sheol and destruction are not satisfied, And the eyes of man are not satisfied.

<sup>21</sup> A refining pot [is] for silver, and a furnace for gold, And a man according to his praise.

<sup>22</sup> If thou dost beat the foolish in a mortar, Among washed things — with a pestle, His folly turneth not aside from off him.

<sup>23</sup> Know well the face of thy flock, Set thy heart to the droves,

<sup>24</sup> For riches [are] not to the age, Nor a crown to generation and generation.

<sup>25</sup> Revealed was the hay, and seen the tender grass, And gathered the herbs of mountains.

<sup>26</sup> Lambs [are] for thy clothing, And the price of the field [are] he-goats,

<sup>27</sup> And a sufficiency of goats' milk [is] for thy bread, For bread to thy house, and life to thy damsels!
