# Chapter 11

<sup>1</sup> Balances of deceit [are] an abomination to Jehovah, And a perfect weight [is] His delight.

<sup>2</sup> Pride hath come, and shame cometh, And with the lowly [is] wisdom.

<sup>3</sup> The integrity of the upright leadeth them, And the perverseness of the treacherous destroyeth them.

<sup>4</sup> Wealth profiteth not in a day of wrath, And righteousness delivereth from death.

<sup>5</sup> The righteousness of the perfect maketh right his way, And by his wickedness doth the wicked fall.

<sup>6</sup> The righteousness of the upright delivereth them, And in mischief the treacherous are captured.

<sup>7</sup> In the death of a wicked man, hope perisheth, And the expectation of the iniquitous hath been lost.

<sup>8</sup> The righteous from distress is drawn out, And the wicked goeth in instead of him.

<sup>9</sup> With the mouth a hypocrite corrupteth his friend, And by knowledge the righteous are drawn out.

<sup>10</sup> In the good of the righteous a city exulteth, And in the destruction of the wicked [is] singing.

<sup>11</sup> By the blessing of the upright is a city exalted, And by the mouth of the wicked thrown down.

<sup>12</sup> Whoso is despising his neighbour lacketh heart, And a man of understanding keepeth silence.

<sup>13</sup> A busybody is revealing secret counsel, And the faithful of spirit is covering the matter.

<sup>14</sup> Without counsels do a people fall, And deliverance [is] in a multitude of counsellors.

<sup>15</sup> Evil [one] suffereth when he hath been surety [for] a stranger, And whoso is hating suretyship is confident.

<sup>16</sup> A gracious woman retaineth honour, And terrible [men] retain riches.

<sup>17</sup> A kind man is rewarding his own soul, And the fierce is troubling his own flesh.

<sup>18</sup> The wicked is getting a lying wage, And whoso is sowing righteousness — a true reward.

<sup>19</sup> Rightly [is] righteousness for life, And whoso is pursuing evil — for his own death.

<sup>20</sup> An abomination to Jehovah [are] the perverse of heart, And the perfect of the way [are] His delight.

<sup>21</sup> Hand to hand, the wicked is not acquitted, And the seed of the righteous hath escaped.

<sup>22</sup> A ring of gold in the nose of a sow — A fair woman and stubborn of behaviour.

<sup>23</sup> The desire of the righteous [is] only good, The hope of the wicked [is] transgression.

<sup>24</sup> There is who is scattering, and yet is increased, And who is keeping back from uprightness, only to want.

<sup>25</sup> A liberal soul is made fat, And whoso is watering, he also is watered.

<sup>26</sup> Whoso is withholding corn, the people execrate him, And a blessing [is] for the head of him who is selling.

<sup>27</sup> Whoso is earnestly seeking good Seeketh a pleasing thing, And whoso is seeking evil — it meeteth him.

<sup>28</sup> Whoso is confident in his wealth he falleth, And as a leaf, the righteous flourish.

<sup>29</sup> Whoso is troubling his own house inheriteth wind, And a servant [is] the fool to the wise of heart.

<sup>30</sup> The fruit of the righteous [is] a tree of life, And whoso is taking souls [is] wise.

<sup>31</sup> Lo, the righteous in the earth is recompensed, Surely also the wicked and the sinner!
