# Chapter 30

<sup>1</sup> Words of a Gatherer, son of an obedient one, the declaration, an affirmation of the man: — I have wearied myself [for] God, I have wearied myself [for] God, and am consumed.

<sup>2</sup> For I am more brutish than any one, And have not the understanding of a man.

<sup>3</sup> Nor have I learned wisdom, Yet the knowledge of Holy Ones I know.

<sup>4</sup> Who went up to heaven, and cometh down? Who hath gathered the wind in his fists? Who hath bound waters in a garment? Who established all ends of the earth? What [is] His name? and what His son's name? Surely thou knowest!

<sup>5</sup> Every saying of God [is] tried, A shield He [is] to those trusting in Him.

<sup>6</sup> Add not to His words, lest He reason with thee, And thou hast been found false.

<sup>7</sup> Two things I have asked from Thee, Withhold not from me before I die.

<sup>8</sup> Vanity and a lying word put far from me, Poverty or wealth give not to me, Cause me to eat the bread of my portion,

<sup>9</sup> Lest I become satiated, and have denied, And have said, 'Who [is] Jehovah?' And lest I be poor, and have stolen, And have laid hold of the name of my God.

<sup>10</sup> Accuse not a servant unto his lord, Lest he disesteem thee, and thou be found guilty.

<sup>11</sup> A generation [is], that lightly esteemeth their father, And their mother doth not bless.

<sup>12</sup> A generation — pure in their own eyes, But from their own filth not washed.

<sup>13</sup> A generation — how high are their eyes, Yea, their eyelids are lifted up.

<sup>14</sup> A generation — swords [are] their teeth, And knives — their jaw-teeth, To consume the poor from earth, And the needy from [among] men.

<sup>15</sup> To the leech [are] two daughters, 'Give, give, Lo, three things are not satisfied, Four have not said 'Sufficiency;'

<sup>16</sup> Sheol, and a restrained womb, Earth — it [is] not satisfied [with] water, And fire — it hath not said, 'Sufficiency,'

<sup>17</sup> An eye that mocketh at a father, And despiseth to obey a mother, Dig it out do ravens of the valley, And eat it do young eagles.

<sup>18</sup> Three things have been too wonderful for me, Yea, four that I have not known:

<sup>19</sup> The way of the eagle in the heavens, The way of a serpent on a rock, The way of a ship in the heart of the sea, And the way of a man in youth.

<sup>20</sup> So — the way of an adulterous woman, She hath eaten and hath wiped her mouth, And hath said, 'I have not done iniquity.'

<sup>21</sup> For three things hath earth been troubled, And for four — it is not able to bear:

<sup>22</sup> For a servant when he reigneth, And a fool when he is satisfied with bread,

<sup>23</sup> For a hated one when she ruleth, And a maid-servant when she succeedeth her mistress.

<sup>24</sup> Four [are] little ones of earth, And they are made wiser than the wise:

<sup>25</sup> The ants [are] a people not strong, And they prepare in summer their food,

<sup>26</sup> Conies [are] a people not strong, And they place in a rock their house,

<sup>27</sup> A king there is not to the locust, And it goeth out — each one shouting,

<sup>28</sup> A spider with two hands taketh hold, And is in the palaces of a king.

<sup>29</sup> Three there are going well, Yea, four are good in going:

<sup>30</sup> An old lion — mighty among beasts, That turneth not back from the face of any,

<sup>31</sup> A girt one of the loins, or a he-goat, And a king — no rising up with him.

<sup>32</sup> If thou hast been foolish in lifting up thyself, And if thou hast devised evil — hand to mouth!

<sup>33</sup> For the churning of milk bringeth out butter, And the wringing of the nose bringeth out blood, And the forcing of anger bringeth out strife!
