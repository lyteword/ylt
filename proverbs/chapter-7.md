# Proverbs 7 

**¹** My son! keep my sayings, And my commands lay up with thee.

**²** Keep my commands, and live, And my law as the pupil of thine eye.

**³** Bind them on thy fingers, Write them on the tablet of thy heart.

**⁴** Say to wisdom, 'My sister Thou [art].' And cry to understanding, 'Kinswoman!'

**⁵** To preserve thee from a strange woman, From a stranger who hath made smooth her sayings.

**⁶** For, at a window of my house, Through my casement I have looked out,

**⁷** And I do see among the simple ones, I discern among the sons, A young man lacking understanding,

**⁸** Passing on in the street, near her corner, And the way [to] her house he doth step,

**⁹** In the twilight — in the evening of day, In the darkness of night and blackness.

**¹⁰** And, lo, a woman to meet him — (A harlot's dress, and watchful of heart,

**¹¹** Noisy she [is], and stubborn, In her house her feet rest not.

**¹²** Now in an out-place, now in broad places, And near every corner she lieth in wait) —

**¹³** And she laid hold on him, and kissed him, She hath hardened her face, and saith to him,

**¹⁴** 'Sacrifices of peace-offerings [are] by me, To-day I have completed my vows.

**¹⁵** Therefore I have come forth to meet thee, To seek earnestly thy face, and I find thee.

**¹⁶** [With] ornamental coverings I decked my couch, Carved works — cotton of Egypt.

**¹⁷** I sprinkled my bed — myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

**¹⁸** Come, we are filled [with] loves till the morning, We delight ourselves in loves.

**¹⁹** For the man is not in his house, He hath gone on a long journey.

**²⁰** A bag of money he hath taken in his hand, At the day of the new moon he cometh to his house.'

**²¹** She turneth him aside with the abundance of her speech, With the flattery of her lips she forceth him.

**²²** He is going after her straightway, As an ox unto the slaughter he cometh, And as a fetter unto the chastisement of a fool,

**²³** Till an arrow doth split his liver, As a bird hath hastened unto a snare, And hath not known that it [is] for its life.

**²⁴** And now, ye sons, hearken to me, And give attention to sayings of my mouth.

**²⁵** Let not thy heart turn unto her ways, Do not wander in her paths,

**²⁶** For many [are] the wounded she caused to fall, And mighty [are] all her slain ones.

**²⁷** The ways of Sheol — her house, Going down unto inner chambers of death!
