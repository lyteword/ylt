# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> My son! to my wisdom give attention, To mine understanding incline thine ear,

<sup>2</sup> To observe thoughtfulness, And knowledge do thy lips keep.

<sup>3</sup> For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And smoother than oil [is] her mouth,

<sup>4</sup> And her latter end [is] bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a sword [with] mouths.

<sup>5</sup> Her feet are going down to death, Sheol do her steps take hold of.

<sup>6</sup> The path of life — lest thou ponder, Moved have her paths — thou knowest not.

<sup>7</sup> And now, ye sons, hearken to me, And turn not from sayings of my mouth.

<sup>8</sup> Keep far from off her thy way, And come not near unto the opening of her house,

<sup>9</sup> Lest thou give to others thy honour, And thy years to the fierce,

<sup>10</sup> Lest strangers be filled [with] thy power, And thy labours in the house of a stranger,

<sup>11</sup> And thou hast howled in thy latter end, In the consumption of thy flesh and thy food,

<sup>12</sup> And hast said, 'How have I hated instruction, And reproof hath my heart despised,

<sup>13</sup> And I have not hearkened to the voice of my directors, And to my teachers have not inclined mine ear.

<sup>14</sup> As a little thing I have been all evil, In the midst of an assembly and a company.

<sup>15</sup> Drink waters out of thine own cistern, Even flowing ones out of thine own well.

<sup>16</sup> Let thy fountains be scattered abroad, In broad places rivulets of waters.

<sup>17</sup> Let them be to thee for thyself, And not to strangers with thee.

<sup>18</sup> Let thy fountain be blessed, And rejoice because of the wife of thy youth,

<sup>19</sup> A hind of loves, and a roe of grace! Let her loves satisfy thee at all times, In her love magnify thyself continually.

<sup>20</sup> And why dost thou magnify thyself, My son, with a stranger? And embrace the bosom of a strange woman?

<sup>21</sup> For over-against the eyes of Jehovah are the ways of each, And all his paths He is pondering.

<sup>22</sup> His own iniquities do capture the wicked, And with the ropes of his sin he is holden.

<sup>23</sup> He dieth without instruction, And in the abundance of his folly magnifieth himself!
