# Chapter 5

**¹** My son! to my wisdom give attention, To mine understanding incline thine ear,

**²** To observe thoughtfulness, And knowledge do thy lips keep.

**³** For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And smoother than oil [is] her mouth,

**⁴** And her latter end [is] bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a sword [with] mouths.

**⁵** Her feet are going down to death, Sheol do her steps take hold of.

**⁶** The path of life — lest thou ponder, Moved have her paths — thou knowest not.

**⁷** And now, ye sons, hearken to me, And turn not from sayings of my mouth.

**⁸** Keep far from off her thy way, And come not near unto the opening of her house,

**⁹** Lest thou give to others thy honour, And thy years to the fierce,

**¹⁰** Lest strangers be filled [with] thy power, And thy labours in the house of a stranger,

**¹¹** And thou hast howled in thy latter end, In the consumption of thy flesh and thy food,

**¹²** And hast said, 'How have I hated instruction, And reproof hath my heart despised,

**¹³** And I have not hearkened to the voice of my directors, And to my teachers have not inclined mine ear.

**¹⁴** As a little thing I have been all evil, In the midst of an assembly and a company.

**¹⁵** Drink waters out of thine own cistern, Even flowing ones out of thine own well.

**¹⁶** Let thy fountains be scattered abroad, In broad places rivulets of waters.

**¹⁷** Let them be to thee for thyself, And not to strangers with thee.

**¹⁸** Let thy fountain be blessed, And rejoice because of the wife of thy youth,

**¹⁹** A hind of loves, and a roe of grace! Let her loves satisfy thee at all times, In her love magnify thyself continually.

**²⁰** And why dost thou magnify thyself, My son, with a stranger? And embrace the bosom of a strange woman?

**²¹** For over-against the eyes of Jehovah are the ways of each, And all his paths He is pondering.

**²²** His own iniquities do capture the wicked, And with the ropes of his sin he is holden.

**²³** He dieth without instruction, And in the abundance of his folly magnifieth himself!
