# Chapter 18

**¹** For [an object of] desire he who is separated doth seek, With all wisdom he intermeddleth.

**²** A fool delighteth not in understanding, But — in uncovering his heart.

**³** With the coming of the wicked come also hath contempt, And with shame — reproach.

**⁴** Deep waters [are] the words of a man's mouth, The fountain of wisdom [is] a flowing brook.

**⁵** Acceptance of the face of the wicked [is] not good, To turn aside the righteous in judgment.

**⁶** The lips of a fool enter into strife, And his mouth for stripes calleth.

**⁷** The mouth of a fool [is] ruin to him, And his lips [are] the snare of his soul.

**⁸** The words of a tale-bearer [are] as self-inflicted wounds, And they have gone down [to] the inner parts of the heart.

**⁹** He also that is remiss in his work, A brother he [is] to a destroyer.

**¹⁰** A tower of strength [is] the name of Jehovah, Into it the righteous runneth, and is set on high.

**¹¹** The wealth of the rich [is] the city of his strength, And as a wall set on high in his own imagination.

**¹²** Before destruction the heart of man is high, And before honour [is] humility.

**¹³** Whoso is answering a matter before he heareth, Folly it is to him and shame.

**¹⁴** The spirit of a man sustaineth his sickness, And a smitten spirit who doth bear?

**¹⁵** The heart of the intelligent getteth knowledge, And the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.

**¹⁶** The gift of a man maketh room for him, And before the great it leadeth him.

**¹⁷** Righteous [is] the first in his own cause, His neighbour cometh and hath searched him.

**¹⁸** The lot causeth contentions to cease, And between the mighty it separateth.

**¹⁹** A brother transgressed against is as a strong city, And contentions as the bar of a palace.

**²⁰** From the fruit of a man's mouth is his belly satisfied, [From the] increase of his lips he is satisfied.

**²¹** Death and life [are] in the power of the tongue, And those loving it eat its fruit.

**²²** [Whoso] hath found a wife hath found good, And bringeth out good-will from Jehovah.

**²³** [With] supplications doth the poor speak, And the rich answereth fierce things.

**²⁴** A man with friends [is] to show himself friendly, And there is a lover adhering more than a brother!
