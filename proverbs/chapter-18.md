# Chapter 18

<sup>1</sup> For [an object of] desire he who is separated doth seek, With all wisdom he intermeddleth.

<sup>2</sup> A fool delighteth not in understanding, But — in uncovering his heart.

<sup>3</sup> With the coming of the wicked come also hath contempt, And with shame — reproach.

<sup>4</sup> Deep waters [are] the words of a man's mouth, The fountain of wisdom [is] a flowing brook.

<sup>5</sup> Acceptance of the face of the wicked [is] not good, To turn aside the righteous in judgment.

<sup>6</sup> The lips of a fool enter into strife, And his mouth for stripes calleth.

<sup>7</sup> The mouth of a fool [is] ruin to him, And his lips [are] the snare of his soul.

<sup>8</sup> The words of a tale-bearer [are] as self-inflicted wounds, And they have gone down [to] the inner parts of the heart.

<sup>9</sup> He also that is remiss in his work, A brother he [is] to a destroyer.

<sup>10</sup> A tower of strength [is] the name of Jehovah, Into it the righteous runneth, and is set on high.

<sup>11</sup> The wealth of the rich [is] the city of his strength, And as a wall set on high in his own imagination.

<sup>12</sup> Before destruction the heart of man is high, And before honour [is] humility.

<sup>13</sup> Whoso is answering a matter before he heareth, Folly it is to him and shame.

<sup>14</sup> The spirit of a man sustaineth his sickness, And a smitten spirit who doth bear?

<sup>15</sup> The heart of the intelligent getteth knowledge, And the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.

<sup>16</sup> The gift of a man maketh room for him, And before the great it leadeth him.

<sup>17</sup> Righteous [is] the first in his own cause, His neighbour cometh and hath searched him.

<sup>18</sup> The lot causeth contentions to cease, And between the mighty it separateth.

<sup>19</sup> A brother transgressed against is as a strong city, And contentions as the bar of a palace.

<sup>20</sup> From the fruit of a man's mouth is his belly satisfied, [From the] increase of his lips he is satisfied.

<sup>21</sup> Death and life [are] in the power of the tongue, And those loving it eat its fruit.

<sup>22</sup> [Whoso] hath found a wife hath found good, And bringeth out good-will from Jehovah.

<sup>23</sup> [With] supplications doth the poor speak, And the rich answereth fierce things.

<sup>24</sup> A man with friends [is] to show himself friendly, And there is a lover adhering more than a brother!
