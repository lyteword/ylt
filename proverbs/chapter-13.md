# Proverbs 13 

**¹** A wise son — the instruction of a father, And a scorner — he hath not heard rebuke.

**²** From the fruit of the mouth a man eateth good, And the soul of the treacherous — violence.

**³** Whoso is keeping his mouth, is keeping his soul, Whoso is opening wide his lips — ruin to him!

**⁴** The soul of the slothful is desiring, and hath not. And the soul of the diligent is made fat.

**⁵** A false word the righteous hateth, And the wicked causeth abhorrence, and is confounded.

**⁶** Righteousness keepeth him who is perfect in the way, And wickedness overthroweth a sin offering.

**⁷** There is who is making himself rich, and hath nothing, Who is making himself poor, and wealth [is] abundant.

**⁸** The ransom of a man's life [are] his riches, And the poor hath not heard rebuke.

**⁹** The light of the righteous rejoiceth, And the lamp of the wicked is extinguished.

**¹⁰** A vain man through pride causeth debate, And with the counselled [is] wisdom.

**¹¹** Wealth from vanity becometh little, And whoso is gathering by the hand becometh great.

**¹²** Hope prolonged is making the heart sick, And a tree of life [is] the coming desire.

**¹³** Whoso is despising the Word is destroyed for it, And whoso is fearing the Command is repayed.

**¹⁴** The law of the wise [is] a fountain of life, To turn aside from snares of death.

**¹⁵** Good understanding giveth grace, And the way of the treacherous [is] hard.

**¹⁶** Every prudent one dealeth with knowledge, And a fool spreadeth out folly.

**¹⁷** A wicked messenger falleth into evil, And a faithful ambassador is healing.

**¹⁸** Whoso is refusing instruction — poverty and shame, And whoso is observing reproof is honoured.

**¹⁹** A desire accomplished is sweet to the soul, And an abomination to fools [is]: Turn from evil.

**²⁰** Whoso is walking with wise men is wise, And a companion of fools suffereth evil.

**²¹** Evil pursueth sinners, And good recompenseth the righteous.

**²²** A good man causeth sons' sons to inherit, And laid up for the righteous [is] the sinner's wealth.

**²³** Abundance of food — the tillage of the poor, And substance is consumed without judgment.

**²⁴** Whoso is sparing his rod is hating his son, And whoso is loving him hath hastened him chastisement.

**²⁵** The righteous is eating to the satiety of his soul, And the belly of the wicked lacketh!
