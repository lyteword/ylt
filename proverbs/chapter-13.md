# Chapter 13

<sup>1</sup> A wise son — the instruction of a father, And a scorner — he hath not heard rebuke.

<sup>2</sup> From the fruit of the mouth a man eateth good, And the soul of the treacherous — violence.

<sup>3</sup> Whoso is keeping his mouth, is keeping his soul, Whoso is opening wide his lips — ruin to him!

<sup>4</sup> The soul of the slothful is desiring, and hath not. And the soul of the diligent is made fat.

<sup>5</sup> A false word the righteous hateth, And the wicked causeth abhorrence, and is confounded.

<sup>6</sup> Righteousness keepeth him who is perfect in the way, And wickedness overthroweth a sin offering.

<sup>7</sup> There is who is making himself rich, and hath nothing, Who is making himself poor, and wealth [is] abundant.

<sup>8</sup> The ransom of a man's life [are] his riches, And the poor hath not heard rebuke.

<sup>9</sup> The light of the righteous rejoiceth, And the lamp of the wicked is extinguished.

<sup>10</sup> A vain man through pride causeth debate, And with the counselled [is] wisdom.

<sup>11</sup> Wealth from vanity becometh little, And whoso is gathering by the hand becometh great.

<sup>12</sup> Hope prolonged is making the heart sick, And a tree of life [is] the coming desire.

<sup>13</sup> Whoso is despising the Word is destroyed for it, And whoso is fearing the Command is repayed.

<sup>14</sup> The law of the wise [is] a fountain of life, To turn aside from snares of death.

<sup>15</sup> Good understanding giveth grace, And the way of the treacherous [is] hard.

<sup>16</sup> Every prudent one dealeth with knowledge, And a fool spreadeth out folly.

<sup>17</sup> A wicked messenger falleth into evil, And a faithful ambassador is healing.

<sup>18</sup> Whoso is refusing instruction — poverty and shame, And whoso is observing reproof is honoured.

<sup>19</sup> A desire accomplished is sweet to the soul, And an abomination to fools [is]: Turn from evil.

<sup>20</sup> Whoso is walking with wise men is wise, And a companion of fools suffereth evil.

<sup>21</sup> Evil pursueth sinners, And good recompenseth the righteous.

<sup>22</sup> A good man causeth sons' sons to inherit, And laid up for the righteous [is] the sinner's wealth.

<sup>23</sup> Abundance of food — the tillage of the poor, And substance is consumed without judgment.

<sup>24</sup> Whoso is sparing his rod is hating his son, And whoso is loving him hath hastened him chastisement.

<sup>25</sup> The righteous is eating to the satiety of his soul, And the belly of the wicked lacketh!
