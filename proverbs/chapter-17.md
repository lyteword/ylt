# Proverbs 17 

**¹** Better [is] a dry morsel, and rest with it, Than a house full of the sacrifices of strife.

**²** A wise servant ruleth over a son causing shame, And in the midst of brethren He apportioneth an inheritance.

**³** A refining pot [is] for silver, and a furnace for gold, And the trier of hearts [is] Jehovah.

**⁴** An evil doer is attentive to lips of vanity, Falsehood is giving ear to a mischievous tongue.

**⁵** Whoso is mocking at the poor Hath reproached his Maker, Whoso is rejoicing at calamity is not acquitted.

**⁶** Sons' sons [are] the crown of old men, And the glory of sons [are] their fathers.

**⁷** Not comely for a fool is a lip of excellency, Much less for a noble a lip of falsehood.

**⁸** A stone of grace [is] the bribe in the eyes of its possessors, Whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.

**⁹** Whoso is covering transgression is seeking love, And whoso is repeating a matter Is separating a familiar friend.

**¹⁰** Rebuke cometh down on the intelligent More than a hundred stripes on a fool.

**¹¹** An evil man seeketh only rebellion, And a fierce messenger is sent against him.

**¹²** The meeting of a bereaved bear by a man, And — not a fool in his folly.

**¹³** Whoso is returning evil for good, Evil moveth not from his house.

**¹⁴** The beginning of contention [is] a letting out of waters, And before it is meddled with leave the strife.

**¹⁵** Whoso is justifying the wicked, And condemning the righteous, Even both of these [are] an abomination to Jehovah.

**¹⁶** Why [is] this — a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, And a heart there is none?

**¹⁷** At all times is the friend loving, And a brother for adversity is born.

**¹⁸** A man lacking heart is striking hands, A surety he becometh before his friend.

**¹⁹** Whoso is loving transgression is loving debate, Whoso is making high his entrance is seeking destruction.

**²⁰** The perverse of heart findeth not good, And the turned in his tongue falleth into evil.

**²¹** Whoso is begetting a fool hath affliction for it, Yea, the father of a fool rejoiceth not.

**²²** A rejoicing heart doth good to the body, And a smitten spirit drieth the bone.

**²³** A bribe from the bosom the wicked taketh, To turn aside the paths of judgment.

**²⁴** The face of the intelligent [is] to wisdom, And the eyes of a fool — at the end of the earth.

**²⁵** A provocation to his father [is] a foolish son, And bitterness to her that bare him.

**²⁶** Also, to fine the righteous is not good, To smite nobles for uprightness.

**²⁷** One acquainted with knowledge is sparing his words, And the cool of temper [is] a man of understanding.

**²⁸** Even a fool keeping silence is reckoned wise, He who is shutting his lips intelligent!
