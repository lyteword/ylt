# Chapter 17

<sup>1</sup> Better [is] a dry morsel, and rest with it, Than a house full of the sacrifices of strife.

<sup>2</sup> A wise servant ruleth over a son causing shame, And in the midst of brethren He apportioneth an inheritance.

<sup>3</sup> A refining pot [is] for silver, and a furnace for gold, And the trier of hearts [is] Jehovah.

<sup>4</sup> An evil doer is attentive to lips of vanity, Falsehood is giving ear to a mischievous tongue.

<sup>5</sup> Whoso is mocking at the poor Hath reproached his Maker, Whoso is rejoicing at calamity is not acquitted.

<sup>6</sup> Sons' sons [are] the crown of old men, And the glory of sons [are] their fathers.

<sup>7</sup> Not comely for a fool is a lip of excellency, Much less for a noble a lip of falsehood.

<sup>8</sup> A stone of grace [is] the bribe in the eyes of its possessors, Whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.

<sup>9</sup> Whoso is covering transgression is seeking love, And whoso is repeating a matter Is separating a familiar friend.

<sup>10</sup> Rebuke cometh down on the intelligent More than a hundred stripes on a fool.

<sup>11</sup> An evil man seeketh only rebellion, And a fierce messenger is sent against him.

<sup>12</sup> The meeting of a bereaved bear by a man, And — not a fool in his folly.

<sup>13</sup> Whoso is returning evil for good, Evil moveth not from his house.

<sup>14</sup> The beginning of contention [is] a letting out of waters, And before it is meddled with leave the strife.

<sup>15</sup> Whoso is justifying the wicked, And condemning the righteous, Even both of these [are] an abomination to Jehovah.

<sup>16</sup> Why [is] this — a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, And a heart there is none?

<sup>17</sup> At all times is the friend loving, And a brother for adversity is born.

<sup>18</sup> A man lacking heart is striking hands, A surety he becometh before his friend.

<sup>19</sup> Whoso is loving transgression is loving debate, Whoso is making high his entrance is seeking destruction.

<sup>20</sup> The perverse of heart findeth not good, And the turned in his tongue falleth into evil.

<sup>21</sup> Whoso is begetting a fool hath affliction for it, Yea, the father of a fool rejoiceth not.

<sup>22</sup> A rejoicing heart doth good to the body, And a smitten spirit drieth the bone.

<sup>23</sup> A bribe from the bosom the wicked taketh, To turn aside the paths of judgment.

<sup>24</sup> The face of the intelligent [is] to wisdom, And the eyes of a fool — at the end of the earth.

<sup>25</sup> A provocation to his father [is] a foolish son, And bitterness to her that bare him.

<sup>26</sup> Also, to fine the righteous is not good, To smite nobles for uprightness.

<sup>27</sup> One acquainted with knowledge is sparing his words, And the cool of temper [is] a man of understanding.

<sup>28</sup> Even a fool keeping silence is reckoned wise, He who is shutting his lips intelligent!
