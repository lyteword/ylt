# Proverbs 29 

**¹** A man often reproved, hardening the neck, Is suddenly broken, and there is no healing.

**²** In the multiplying of the righteous the people rejoice, And in the ruling of the wicked the people sigh.

**³** A man loving wisdom rejoiceth his father, And a friend of harlots destroyeth wealth.

**⁴** A king by judgment establisheth a land, And one receiving gifts throweth it down.

**⁵** A man taking a portion above his neighbour, Spreadeth a net for his own steps.

**⁶** In the transgression of the evil [is] a snare, And the righteous doth sing and rejoice.

**⁷** The righteous knoweth the plea of the poor, The wicked understandeth not knowledge.

**⁸** Men of scorning ensnare a city, And the wise turn back anger.

**⁹** A wise man is judged by the foolish man, And he hath been angry, And he hath laughed, and there is no rest.

**¹⁰** Men of blood hate the perfect, And the upright seek his soul.

**¹¹** A fool bringeth out all his mind, And the wise till afterwards restraineth it.

**¹²** A ruler who is attending to lying words, All his ministers [are] wicked.

**¹³** The poor and the man of frauds have met together, Jehovah is enlightening the eyes of them both.

**¹⁴** a king that is judging truly the poor, His throne for ever is established.

**¹⁵** A rod and reproof give wisdom, And a youth let away is shaming his mother.

**¹⁶** In the multiplying of the wicked transgression multiplieth, And the righteous on their fall do look.

**¹⁷** Chastise thy son, and he giveth thee comfort, Yea, he giveth delights to thy soul.

**¹⁸** Without a Vision is a people made naked, And whoso is keeping the law, O his happiness!

**¹⁹** By words a servant is not instructed though he understand, And there is nothing answering.

**²⁰** Thou hast seen a man hasty in his words! More hope of a fool than of him.

**²¹** Whoso is bringing up his servant delicately, from youth, [At] his latter end also he is continuator.

**²²** An angry man stirreth up contention, And a furious man is multiplying transgression.

**²³** The pride of man humbleth him, And humility of spirit upholdeth honour.

**²⁴** Whoso is sharing with a thief is hating his own soul, Execration he heareth, and telleth not.

**²⁵** Fear of man causeth a snare, And the confident in Jehovah is set on high.

**²⁶** Many are seeking the face of a ruler, And from Jehovah [is] the judgment of each.

**²⁷** An abomination to the righteous [is] the perverse man, And an abomination to the wicked [is] the upright in the way!
