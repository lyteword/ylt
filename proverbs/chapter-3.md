# Proverbs 3 

**¹** My son! my law forget not, And my commands let thy heart keep,

**²** For length of days and years, Life and peace they do add to thee.

**³** Let not kindness and truth forsake thee, Bind them on thy neck, Write them on the tablet of thy heart,

**⁴** And find grace and good understanding In the eyes of God and man.

**⁵** Trust unto Jehovah with all thy heart, And unto thine own understanding lean not.

**⁶** In all thy ways know thou Him, And He doth make straight thy paths.

**⁷** Be not wise in thine own eyes, Fear Jehovah, and turn aside from evil.

**⁸** Healing it is to thy navel, And moistening to thy bones.

**⁹** Honour Jehovah from thy substance, And from the beginning of all thine increase;

**¹⁰** And filled are thy barns [with] plenty, And [with] new wine thy presses break forth.

**¹¹** Chastisement of Jehovah, my son, despise not, And be not vexed with His reproof,

**¹²** For whom Jehovah loveth He reproveth, Even as a father the son He is pleased with.

**¹³** O the happiness of a man [who] hath found wisdom, And of a man [who] bringeth forth understanding.

**¹⁴** For better [is] her merchandise Than the merchandise of silver, And than gold — her increase.

**¹⁵** Precious she [is] above rubies, And all thy pleasures are not comparable to her.

**¹⁶** Length of days [is] in her right hand, In her left [are] wealth and honour.

**¹⁷** Her ways [are] ways of pleasantness, And all her paths [are] peace.

**¹⁸** A tree of life she [is] to those laying hold on her, And whoso is retaining her [is] happy.

**¹⁹** Jehovah by wisdom did found the earth, He prepared the heavens by understanding.

**²⁰** By His knowledge depths have been rent, And clouds do drop dew.

**²¹** My son! let them not turn from thine eyes, Keep thou wisdom and thoughtfulness,

**²²** And they are life to thy soul, and grace to thy neck.

**²³** Then thou goest thy way confidently, And thy foot doth not stumble.

**²⁴** If thou liest down, thou art not afraid, Yea, thou hast lain down, And sweet hath been thy sleep.

**²⁵** Be not afraid of sudden fear, And of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh.

**²⁶** For Jehovah is at thy side, And He hath kept thy foot from capture.

**²⁷** Withhold not good from its owners, When thy hand [is] toward God to do [it].

**²⁸** Say not thou to thy friend, 'Go, and return, and to-morrow I give,' And substance with thee.

**²⁹** Devise not against thy neighbour evil, And he sitting confidently with thee.

**³⁰** Strive not with a man without cause, If he have not done thee evil.

**³¹** Be not envious of a man of violence, Nor fix thou on any of his ways.

**³²** For an abomination to Jehovah [is] the perverted, And with the upright [is] His secret counsel.

**³³** The curse of Jehovah [is] in the house of the wicked. And the habitation of the righteous He blesseth.

**³⁴** If the scorners He doth scorn, Yet to the humble He doth give grace.

**³⁵** Honour do the wise inherit, And fools are bearing away shame!
