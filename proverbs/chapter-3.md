# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> My son! my law forget not, And my commands let thy heart keep,

<sup>2</sup> For length of days and years, Life and peace they do add to thee.

<sup>3</sup> Let not kindness and truth forsake thee, Bind them on thy neck, Write them on the tablet of thy heart,

<sup>4</sup> And find grace and good understanding In the eyes of God and man.

<sup>5</sup> Trust unto Jehovah with all thy heart, And unto thine own understanding lean not.

<sup>6</sup> In all thy ways know thou Him, And He doth make straight thy paths.

<sup>7</sup> Be not wise in thine own eyes, Fear Jehovah, and turn aside from evil.

<sup>8</sup> Healing it is to thy navel, And moistening to thy bones.

<sup>9</sup> Honour Jehovah from thy substance, And from the beginning of all thine increase;

<sup>10</sup> And filled are thy barns [with] plenty, And [with] new wine thy presses break forth.

<sup>11</sup> Chastisement of Jehovah, my son, despise not, And be not vexed with His reproof,

<sup>12</sup> For whom Jehovah loveth He reproveth, Even as a father the son He is pleased with.

<sup>13</sup> O the happiness of a man [who] hath found wisdom, And of a man [who] bringeth forth understanding.

<sup>14</sup> For better [is] her merchandise Than the merchandise of silver, And than gold — her increase.

<sup>15</sup> Precious she [is] above rubies, And all thy pleasures are not comparable to her.

<sup>16</sup> Length of days [is] in her right hand, In her left [are] wealth and honour.

<sup>17</sup> Her ways [are] ways of pleasantness, And all her paths [are] peace.

<sup>18</sup> A tree of life she [is] to those laying hold on her, And whoso is retaining her [is] happy.

<sup>19</sup> Jehovah by wisdom did found the earth, He prepared the heavens by understanding.

<sup>20</sup> By His knowledge depths have been rent, And clouds do drop dew.

<sup>21</sup> My son! let them not turn from thine eyes, Keep thou wisdom and thoughtfulness,

<sup>22</sup> And they are life to thy soul, and grace to thy neck.

<sup>23</sup> Then thou goest thy way confidently, And thy foot doth not stumble.

<sup>24</sup> If thou liest down, thou art not afraid, Yea, thou hast lain down, And sweet hath been thy sleep.

<sup>25</sup> Be not afraid of sudden fear, And of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh.

<sup>26</sup> For Jehovah is at thy side, And He hath kept thy foot from capture.

<sup>27</sup> Withhold not good from its owners, When thy hand [is] toward God to do [it].

<sup>28</sup> Say not thou to thy friend, 'Go, and return, and to-morrow I give,' And substance with thee.

<sup>29</sup> Devise not against thy neighbour evil, And he sitting confidently with thee.

<sup>30</sup> Strive not with a man without cause, If he have not done thee evil.

<sup>31</sup> Be not envious of a man of violence, Nor fix thou on any of his ways.

<sup>32</sup> For an abomination to Jehovah [is] the perverted, And with the upright [is] His secret counsel.

<sup>33</sup> The curse of Jehovah [is] in the house of the wicked. And the habitation of the righteous He blesseth.

<sup>34</sup> If the scorners He doth scorn, Yet to the humble He doth give grace.

<sup>35</sup> Honour do the wise inherit, And fools are bearing away shame!
