# Chapter 15

**¹** A soft answer turneth back fury, And a grievous word raiseth up anger.

**²** The tongue of the wise maketh knowledge good, And the mouth of fools uttereth folly.

**³** In every place are the eyes of Jehovah, Watching the evil and the good.

**⁴** A healed tongue [is] a tree of life, And perverseness in it — a breach in the spirit.

**⁵** A fool despiseth the instruction of his father, And whoso is regarding reproof is prudent.

**⁶** [In] the house of the righteous [is] abundant strength, And in the increase of the wicked — trouble.

**⁷** The lips of the wise scatter knowledge, And the heart of fools [is] not right.

**⁸** The sacrifice of the wicked [is] an abomination to Jehovah, And the prayer of the upright [is] His delight.

**⁹** An abomination to Jehovah [is] the way of the wicked, And whoso is pursuing righteousness He loveth.

**¹⁰** Chastisement [is] grievous to him who is forsaking the path, Whoso is hating reproof dieth.

**¹¹** Sheol and destruction [are] before Jehovah, Surely also the hearts of the sons of men.

**¹²** A scorner loveth not his reprover, Unto the wise he goeth not.

**¹³** A joyful heart maketh glad the face, And by grief of heart is the spirit smitten.

**¹⁴** The heart of the intelligent seeketh knowledge, And the mouth of fools enjoyeth folly.

**¹⁵** All the days of the afflicted [are] evil, And gladness of heart [is] a perpetual banquet.

**¹⁶** Better [is] a little with the fear of Jehovah, Than much treasure, and tumult with it.

**¹⁷** Better [is] an allowance of green herbs and love there, Than a fatted ox, and hatred with it.

**¹⁸** A man of fury stirreth up contention, And the slow to anger appeaseth strife.

**¹⁹** The way of the slothful [is] as a hedge of briers, And the path of the upright is raised up.

**²⁰** A wise son rejoiceth a father. And a foolish man is despising his mother.

**²¹** Folly is joy to one lacking heart, And a man of intelligence directeth [his] going.

**²²** Without counsel [is] the making void of purposes, And in a multitude of counsellors it is established.

**²³** Joy [is] to a man in the answer of his mouth, And a word in its season — how good!

**²⁴** A path of life [is] on high for the wise, To turn aside from Sheol beneath.

**²⁵** The house of the proud Jehovah pulleth down, And He setteth up the border of the widow.

**²⁶** An abomination to Jehovah [are] thoughts of wickedness, And pure [are] sayings of pleasantness.

**²⁷** A dishonest gainer is troubling his house, And whoso is hating gifts liveth.

**²⁸** The heart of the righteous meditateth to answer, And the mouth of the wicked uttereth evil things.

**²⁹** Far [is] Jehovah from the wicked, And the prayer of the righteous He heareth.

**³⁰** The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart, A good report maketh fat the bone.

**³¹** An ear that is hearing the reproof of life Doth lodge among the wise.

**³²** Whoso is refusing instruction is despising his soul, And whoso is hearing reproof Is getting understanding.

**³³** The fear of Jehovah [is] the instruction of wisdom, And before honour [is] humility!
