# Chapter 15

<sup>1</sup> A soft answer turneth back fury, And a grievous word raiseth up anger.

<sup>2</sup> The tongue of the wise maketh knowledge good, And the mouth of fools uttereth folly.

<sup>3</sup> In every place are the eyes of Jehovah, Watching the evil and the good.

<sup>4</sup> A healed tongue [is] a tree of life, And perverseness in it — a breach in the spirit.

<sup>5</sup> A fool despiseth the instruction of his father, And whoso is regarding reproof is prudent.

<sup>6</sup> [In] the house of the righteous [is] abundant strength, And in the increase of the wicked — trouble.

<sup>7</sup> The lips of the wise scatter knowledge, And the heart of fools [is] not right.

<sup>8</sup> The sacrifice of the wicked [is] an abomination to Jehovah, And the prayer of the upright [is] His delight.

<sup>9</sup> An abomination to Jehovah [is] the way of the wicked, And whoso is pursuing righteousness He loveth.

<sup>10</sup> Chastisement [is] grievous to him who is forsaking the path, Whoso is hating reproof dieth.

<sup>11</sup> Sheol and destruction [are] before Jehovah, Surely also the hearts of the sons of men.

<sup>12</sup> A scorner loveth not his reprover, Unto the wise he goeth not.

<sup>13</sup> A joyful heart maketh glad the face, And by grief of heart is the spirit smitten.

<sup>14</sup> The heart of the intelligent seeketh knowledge, And the mouth of fools enjoyeth folly.

<sup>15</sup> All the days of the afflicted [are] evil, And gladness of heart [is] a perpetual banquet.

<sup>16</sup> Better [is] a little with the fear of Jehovah, Than much treasure, and tumult with it.

<sup>17</sup> Better [is] an allowance of green herbs and love there, Than a fatted ox, and hatred with it.

<sup>18</sup> A man of fury stirreth up contention, And the slow to anger appeaseth strife.

<sup>19</sup> The way of the slothful [is] as a hedge of briers, And the path of the upright is raised up.

<sup>20</sup> A wise son rejoiceth a father. And a foolish man is despising his mother.

<sup>21</sup> Folly is joy to one lacking heart, And a man of intelligence directeth [his] going.

<sup>22</sup> Without counsel [is] the making void of purposes, And in a multitude of counsellors it is established.

<sup>23</sup> Joy [is] to a man in the answer of his mouth, And a word in its season — how good!

<sup>24</sup> A path of life [is] on high for the wise, To turn aside from Sheol beneath.

<sup>25</sup> The house of the proud Jehovah pulleth down, And He setteth up the border of the widow.

<sup>26</sup> An abomination to Jehovah [are] thoughts of wickedness, And pure [are] sayings of pleasantness.

<sup>27</sup> A dishonest gainer is troubling his house, And whoso is hating gifts liveth.

<sup>28</sup> The heart of the righteous meditateth to answer, And the mouth of the wicked uttereth evil things.

<sup>29</sup> Far [is] Jehovah from the wicked, And the prayer of the righteous He heareth.

<sup>30</sup> The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart, A good report maketh fat the bone.

<sup>31</sup> An ear that is hearing the reproof of life Doth lodge among the wise.

<sup>32</sup> Whoso is refusing instruction is despising his soul, And whoso is hearing reproof Is getting understanding.

<sup>33</sup> The fear of Jehovah [is] the instruction of wisdom, And before honour [is] humility!
