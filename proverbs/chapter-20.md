# Chapter 20

<sup>1</sup> Wine [is] a scorner — strong drink [is] noisy, And any going astray in it is not wise.

<sup>2</sup> The fear of a king [is] a growl as of a young lion, He who is causing him to be wroth is wronging his soul.

<sup>3</sup> An honour to a man is cessation from strife, And every fool intermeddleth.

<sup>4</sup> Because of winter the slothful plougheth not, He asketh in harvest, and there is nothing.

<sup>5</sup> Counsel in the heart of a man [is] deep water, And a man of understanding draweth it up.

<sup>6</sup> A multitude of men proclaim each his kindness, And a man of stedfastness who doth find?

<sup>7</sup> The righteous is walking habitually in his integrity, O the happiness of his sons after him!

<sup>8</sup> A king sitting on a throne of judgment, Is scattering with his eyes all evil,

<sup>9</sup> Who saith, 'I have purified my heart, I have been cleansed from my sin?'

<sup>10</sup> A stone and a stone, an ephah and an ephah, Even both of them [are] an abomination to Jehovah.

<sup>11</sup> Even by his actions a youth maketh himself known, Whether his work be pure or upright.

<sup>12</sup> A hearing ear, and a seeing eye, Jehovah hath made even both of them.

<sup>13</sup> Love not sleep, lest thou become poor, Open thine eyes — be satisfied [with] bread.

<sup>14</sup> 'Bad, bad,' saith the buyer, And going his way then he boasteth himself.

<sup>15</sup> Substance, gold, and a multitude of rubies, Yea, a precious vessel, [are] lips of knowledge.

<sup>16</sup> Take his garment when a stranger hath been surety, And for strangers pledge it.

<sup>17</sup> Sweet to a man [is] the bread of falsehood, And afterwards is his mouth filled [with] gravel.

<sup>18</sup> Purposes by counsel thou dost establish, And with plans make thou war.

<sup>19</sup> A revealer of secret counsels is the busybody, And for a deceiver [with] his lips make not thyself surety.

<sup>20</sup> Whoso is vilifying his father and his mother, Extinguished is his lamp in blackness of darkness.

<sup>21</sup> An inheritance gotten wrongly at first, Even its latter end is not blessed.

<sup>22</sup> Do not say, 'I recompense evil,' Wait for Jehovah, and He delivereth thee.

<sup>23</sup> An abomination to Jehovah [are] a stone and a stone, And balances of deceit [are] not good.

<sup>24</sup> From Jehovah [are] the steps of a man, And man — how understandeth he his way?

<sup>25</sup> A snare to a man [is] he hath swallowed a holy thing, And after vows to make inquiry.

<sup>26</sup> A wise king is scattering the wicked, And turneth back on them the wheel.

<sup>27</sup> The breath of man [is] a lamp of Jehovah, Searching all the inner parts of the heart.

<sup>28</sup> Kindness and truth keep a king, And he hath supported by kindness his throne.

<sup>29</sup> The beauty of young men is their strength, And the honour of old men is grey hairs.

<sup>30</sup> The bandages of a wound thou removest with the evil, Also the plagues of the inner parts of the heart!
