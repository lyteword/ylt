# Chapter 20

**¹** Wine [is] a scorner — strong drink [is] noisy, And any going astray in it is not wise.

**²** The fear of a king [is] a growl as of a young lion, He who is causing him to be wroth is wronging his soul.

**³** An honour to a man is cessation from strife, And every fool intermeddleth.

**⁴** Because of winter the slothful plougheth not, He asketh in harvest, and there is nothing.

**⁵** Counsel in the heart of a man [is] deep water, And a man of understanding draweth it up.

**⁶** A multitude of men proclaim each his kindness, And a man of stedfastness who doth find?

**⁷** The righteous is walking habitually in his integrity, O the happiness of his sons after him!

**⁸** A king sitting on a throne of judgment, Is scattering with his eyes all evil,

**⁹** Who saith, 'I have purified my heart, I have been cleansed from my sin?'

**¹⁰** A stone and a stone, an ephah and an ephah, Even both of them [are] an abomination to Jehovah.

**¹¹** Even by his actions a youth maketh himself known, Whether his work be pure or upright.

**¹²** A hearing ear, and a seeing eye, Jehovah hath made even both of them.

**¹³** Love not sleep, lest thou become poor, Open thine eyes — be satisfied [with] bread.

**¹⁴** 'Bad, bad,' saith the buyer, And going his way then he boasteth himself.

**¹⁵** Substance, gold, and a multitude of rubies, Yea, a precious vessel, [are] lips of knowledge.

**¹⁶** Take his garment when a stranger hath been surety, And for strangers pledge it.

**¹⁷** Sweet to a man [is] the bread of falsehood, And afterwards is his mouth filled [with] gravel.

**¹⁸** Purposes by counsel thou dost establish, And with plans make thou war.

**¹⁹** A revealer of secret counsels is the busybody, And for a deceiver [with] his lips make not thyself surety.

**²⁰** Whoso is vilifying his father and his mother, Extinguished is his lamp in blackness of darkness.

**²¹** An inheritance gotten wrongly at first, Even its latter end is not blessed.

**²²** Do not say, 'I recompense evil,' Wait for Jehovah, and He delivereth thee.

**²³** An abomination to Jehovah [are] a stone and a stone, And balances of deceit [are] not good.

**²⁴** From Jehovah [are] the steps of a man, And man — how understandeth he his way?

**²⁵** A snare to a man [is] he hath swallowed a holy thing, And after vows to make inquiry.

**²⁶** A wise king is scattering the wicked, And turneth back on them the wheel.

**²⁷** The breath of man [is] a lamp of Jehovah, Searching all the inner parts of the heart.

**²⁸** Kindness and truth keep a king, And he hath supported by kindness his throne.

**²⁹** The beauty of young men is their strength, And the honour of old men is grey hairs.

**³⁰** The bandages of a wound thou removest with the evil, Also the plagues of the inner parts of the heart!
