# Chapter 1

<sup>1</sup> Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:

<sup>2</sup> For knowing wisdom and instruction, For understanding sayings of intelligence,

<sup>3</sup> For receiving the instruction of wisdom, Righteousness, judgment, and uprightness,

<sup>4</sup> For giving to simple ones — prudence, To a youth — knowledge and discretion.

<sup>5</sup> (The wise doth hear and increaseth learning, And the intelligent doth obtain counsels.)

<sup>6</sup> For understanding a proverb and its sweetness, Words of the wise and their acute sayings.

<sup>7</sup> Fear of Jehovah [is] a beginning of knowledge, Wisdom and instruction fools have despised!

<sup>8</sup> Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, And leave not the law of thy mother,

<sup>9</sup> For a graceful wreath [are] they to thy head, And chains to thy neck.

<sup>10</sup> My son, if sinners entice thee be not willing.

<sup>11</sup> If they say, 'Come with us, we lay wait for blood, We watch secretly for the innocent without cause,

<sup>12</sup> We swallow them as Sheol — alive, And whole — as those going down [to] the pit,

<sup>13</sup> Every precious substance we find, We fill our houses [with] spoil,

<sup>14</sup> Thy lot thou dost cast among us, One purse is — to all of us.'

<sup>15</sup> My son! go not in the way with them, Withhold thy foot from their path,

<sup>16</sup> For their feet to evil do run, And they haste to shed blood.

<sup>17</sup> Surely in vain is the net spread out before the eyes of any bird.

<sup>18</sup> And they for their own blood lay wait, They watch secretly for their own lives.

<sup>19</sup> So [are] the paths of every gainer of dishonest gain, The life of its owners it taketh.

<sup>20</sup> Wisdom in an out-place crieth aloud, In broad places she giveth forth her voice,

<sup>21</sup> At the head of the multitudes she calleth, In the openings of the gates, In the city her sayings she saith:

<sup>22</sup> 'Till when, ye simple, do ye love simplicity? And have scorners their scorning desired? And do fools hate knowledge?

<sup>23</sup> Turn back at my reproof, lo, I pour forth to you my spirit, I make known my words with you.

<sup>24</sup> Because I have called, and ye refuse, I stretched out my hand, and none is attending,

<sup>25</sup> And ye slight all my counsel, And my reproof ye have not desired.

<sup>26</sup> I also in your calamity do laugh, I deride when your fear cometh,

<sup>27</sup> When your fear cometh as destruction, And your calamity as a hurricane doth come, When on you come adversity and distress.

<sup>28</sup> Then they call me, and I do not answer, They seek me earnestly, and find me not.

<sup>29</sup> Because that they have hated knowledge, And the fear of Jehovah have not chosen.

<sup>30</sup> They have not consented to my counsel, They have despised all my reproof,

<sup>31</sup> And they eat of the fruit of their way, And from their own counsels they are filled.

<sup>32</sup> For the turning of the simple slayeth them, And the security of the foolish destroyeth them.

<sup>33</sup> And whoso is hearkening to me dwelleth confidently, And [is] quiet from fear of evil!'
