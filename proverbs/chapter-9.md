# Chapter 9

<sup>1</sup> Wisdom hath builded her house, She hath hewn out her pillars — seven.

<sup>2</sup> She hath slaughtered her slaughter, She hath mingled her wine, Yea, she hath arranged her table.

<sup>3</sup> She hath sent forth her damsels, She crieth on the tops of the high places of the city:

<sup>4</sup> 'Who [is] simple? let him turn aside hither.' Whoso lacketh heart: she hath said to him,

<sup>5</sup> 'Come, eat of my bread, And drink of the wine I have mingled.

<sup>6</sup> Forsake ye, the simple, and live, And be happy in the way of understanding.

<sup>7</sup> The instructor of a scorner Is receiving for it — shame, And a reprover of the wicked — his blemish.

<sup>8</sup> Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee, Give reproof to the wise, and he loveth thee.

<sup>9</sup> Give to the wise, and he is wiser still, Make known to the righteous, And he increaseth learning.

<sup>10</sup> The commencement of wisdom [is] the fear of Jehovah, And a knowledge of the Holy Ones [is] understanding.

<sup>11</sup> For by me do thy days multiply, And added to thee are years of life.

<sup>12</sup> If thou hast been wise, thou hast been wise for thyself, And thou hast scorned — thyself bearest [it].

<sup>13</sup> A foolish woman [is] noisy, Simple, and hath not known what.

<sup>14</sup> And she hath sat at the opening of her house, On a throne — the high places of the city,

<sup>15</sup> To call to those passing by the way, Who are going straight [on] their paths.

<sup>16</sup> 'Who [is] simple? let him turn aside hither.' And whoso lacketh heart — she said to him,

<sup>17</sup> 'Stolen waters are sweet, And hidden bread is pleasant.'

<sup>18</sup> And he hath not known that Rephaim [are] there, In deep places of Sheol her invited ones!
