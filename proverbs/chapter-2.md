# Chapter 2

<sup>1</sup> My son, if thou dost accept my sayings, And my commands dost lay up with thee,

<sup>2</sup> To cause thine ear to attend to wisdom, Thou inclinest thy heart to understanding,

<sup>3</sup> For, if for intelligence thou callest, For understanding givest forth thy voice,

<sup>4</sup> If thou dost seek her as silver, And as hid treasures searchest for her,

<sup>5</sup> Then understandest thou fear of Jehovah, And knowledge of God thou findest.

<sup>6</sup> For Jehovah giveth wisdom, From His mouth knowledge and understanding.

<sup>7</sup> Even to lay up for the upright substance, A shield for those walking uprightly.

<sup>8</sup> To keep the paths of judgment, And the way of His saints He preserveth.

<sup>9</sup> Then understandest thou righteousness, And judgment, and uprightness — every good path.

<sup>10</sup> For wisdom cometh into thy heart, And knowledge to thy soul is pleasant,

<sup>11</sup> Thoughtfulness doth watch over thee, Understanding doth keep thee,

<sup>12</sup> To deliver thee from an evil way, From any speaking froward things,

<sup>13</sup> Who are forsaking paths of uprightness, To walk in ways of darkness,

<sup>14</sup> Who are rejoicing to do evil, They delight in frowardness of the wicked,

<sup>15</sup> Whose paths [are] crooked, Yea, they are perverted in their ways.

<sup>16</sup> To deliver thee from the strange woman, From the stranger who hath made smooth her sayings,

<sup>17</sup> Who is forsaking the guide of her youth, And the covenant of her God hath forgotten.

<sup>18</sup> For her house hath inclined unto death, And unto Rephaim her paths.

<sup>19</sup> None going in unto her turn back, Nor do they reach the paths of life.

<sup>20</sup> That thou dost go in the way of the good, And the paths of the righteous dost keep.

<sup>21</sup> For the upright do inhabit the earth, And the perfect are left in it,

<sup>22</sup> And the wicked from the earth are cut off, And treacherous dealers plucked out of it!
