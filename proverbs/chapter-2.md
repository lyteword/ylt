# Chapter 2

**¹** My son, if thou dost accept my sayings, And my commands dost lay up with thee,

**²** To cause thine ear to attend to wisdom, Thou inclinest thy heart to understanding,

**³** For, if for intelligence thou callest, For understanding givest forth thy voice,

**⁴** If thou dost seek her as silver, And as hid treasures searchest for her,

**⁵** Then understandest thou fear of Jehovah, And knowledge of God thou findest.

**⁶** For Jehovah giveth wisdom, From His mouth knowledge and understanding.

**⁷** Even to lay up for the upright substance, A shield for those walking uprightly.

**⁸** To keep the paths of judgment, And the way of His saints He preserveth.

**⁹** Then understandest thou righteousness, And judgment, and uprightness — every good path.

**¹⁰** For wisdom cometh into thy heart, And knowledge to thy soul is pleasant,

**¹¹** Thoughtfulness doth watch over thee, Understanding doth keep thee,

**¹²** To deliver thee from an evil way, From any speaking froward things,

**¹³** Who are forsaking paths of uprightness, To walk in ways of darkness,

**¹⁴** Who are rejoicing to do evil, They delight in frowardness of the wicked,

**¹⁵** Whose paths [are] crooked, Yea, they are perverted in their ways.

**¹⁶** To deliver thee from the strange woman, From the stranger who hath made smooth her sayings,

**¹⁷** Who is forsaking the guide of her youth, And the covenant of her God hath forgotten.

**¹⁸** For her house hath inclined unto death, And unto Rephaim her paths.

**¹⁹** None going in unto her turn back, Nor do they reach the paths of life.

**²⁰** That thou dost go in the way of the good, And the paths of the righteous dost keep.

**²¹** For the upright do inhabit the earth, And the perfect are left in it,

**²²** And the wicked from the earth are cut off, And treacherous dealers plucked out of it!
