# Proverbs 26 

**¹** As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, So honour [is] not comely for a fool.

**²** As a bird by wandering, as a swallow by flying, So reviling without cause doth not come.

**³** A whip is for a horse, a bridle for an ass, And a rod for the back of fools.

**⁴** Answer not a fool according to his folly, Lest thou be like to him — even thou.

**⁵** Answer a fool according to his folly, Lest he be wise in his own eyes.

**⁶** He is cutting off feet, he is drinking injury, Who is sending things by the hand of a fool.

**⁷** Weak have been the two legs of the lame, And a parable in the mouth of fools.

**⁸** As one who is binding a stone in a sling, So [is] he who is giving honour to a fool.

**⁹** A thorn hath gone up into the hand of a drunkard, And a parable in the mouth of fools.

**¹⁰** Great [is] the Former of all, And He is rewarding a fool, And is rewarding transgressors.

**¹¹** As a dog hath returned to its vomit, A fool is repeating his folly.

**¹²** Thou hast seen a man wise in his own eyes, More hope of a fool than of him!

**¹³** The slothful hath said, 'A lion [is] in the way, A lion [is] in the broad places.'

**¹⁴** The door turneth round on its hinge, And the slothful on his bed.

**¹⁵** The slothful hath hid his hand in a dish, He is weary of bringing it back to his mouth.

**¹⁶** Wiser [is] the slothful in his own eyes, Than seven [men] returning a reason.

**¹⁷** Laying hold on the ears of a dog, [Is] a passer-by making himself wrath for strife not his own.

**¹⁸** As [one] pretending to be feeble, Who is casting sparks, arrows, and death,

**¹⁹** So hath a man deceived his neighbour, And hath said, 'Am not I playing?'

**²⁰** Without wood is fire going out, And without a tale-bearer, contention ceaseth,

**²¹** Coal to burning coals, and wood to fire, And a man of contentions to kindle strife.

**²²** The words of a tale-bearer [are] as self-inflicted wounds, And they have gone down [to] the inner parts of the heart.

**²³** Silver of dross spread over potsherd, [Are] burning lips and an evil heart.

**²⁴** By his lips doth a hater dissemble, And in his heart he placeth deceit,

**²⁵** When his voice is gracious trust not in him, For seven abominations [are] in his heart.

**²⁶** Hatred is covered by deceit, Revealed is its wickedness in an assembly.

**²⁷** Whoso is digging a pit falleth into it, And the roller of a stone, to him it turneth.

**²⁸** A lying tongue hateth its bruised ones, And a flattering mouth worketh an overthrow!
