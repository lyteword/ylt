# Chapter 4

<sup>1</sup> Hear, ye sons, the instruction of a father, And give attention to know understanding.

<sup>2</sup> For good learning I have given to you, My law forsake not.

<sup>3</sup> For, a son I have been to my father — tender, And an only one before my mother.

<sup>4</sup> And he directeth me, and he saith to me: 'Let thy heart retain my words, Keep my commands, and live.

<sup>5</sup> Get wisdom, get understanding, Do not forget, nor turn away From the sayings of my mouth.

<sup>6</sup> Forsake her not, and she doth preserve thee, Love her, and she doth keep thee.

<sup>7</sup> The first thing [is] wisdom — get wisdom, And with all thy getting get understanding.

<sup>8</sup> Exalt her, and she doth lift thee up, She honoureth thee, when thou dost embrace her.

<sup>9</sup> She giveth to thy head a wreath of grace, A crown of beauty she doth give thee freely.

<sup>10</sup> Hear, my son, and receive my sayings, And years of life [are] multiplied to thee.

<sup>11</sup> In a way of wisdom I have directed thee, I have caused thee to tread in paths of uprightness.

<sup>12</sup> In thy walking thy step is not straitened, And if thou runnest, thou stumblest not.

<sup>13</sup> Lay hold on instruction, do not desist, Keep her, for she [is] thy life.

<sup>14</sup> Into the path of the wicked enter not, And be not happy in a way of evil doers.

<sup>15</sup> Avoid it, pass not over into it, Turn aside from it, and pass on.

<sup>16</sup> For they sleep not if they do not evil, And their sleep hath been taken violently away, If they cause not [some] to stumble.

<sup>17</sup> For they have eaten bread of wickedness, And wine of violence they drink.

<sup>18</sup> And the path of the righteous [is] as a shining light, Going and brightening till the day is established,

<sup>19</sup> The way of the wicked [is] as darkness, They have not known at what they stumble.

<sup>20</sup> My son, to my words give attention, To my sayings incline thine ear,

<sup>21</sup> Let them not turn aside from thine eyes, Preserve them in the midst of thy heart.

<sup>22</sup> For life they [are] to those finding them, And to all their flesh healing.

<sup>23</sup> Above every charge keep thy heart, For out of it [are] the outgoings of life.

<sup>24</sup> Turn aside from thee a froward mouth, And perverse lips put far from thee,

<sup>25</sup> Thine eyes do look straightforward, And thine eyelids look straight before thee.

<sup>26</sup> Ponder thou the path of thy feet, And all thy ways [are] established.

<sup>27</sup> Incline not [to] the right or to the left, Turn aside thy foot from evil!
