# Proverbs 4 

**¹** Hear, ye sons, the instruction of a father, And give attention to know understanding.

**²** For good learning I have given to you, My law forsake not.

**³** For, a son I have been to my father — tender, And an only one before my mother.

**⁴** And he directeth me, and he saith to me: 'Let thy heart retain my words, Keep my commands, and live.

**⁵** Get wisdom, get understanding, Do not forget, nor turn away From the sayings of my mouth.

**⁶** Forsake her not, and she doth preserve thee, Love her, and she doth keep thee.

**⁷** The first thing [is] wisdom — get wisdom, And with all thy getting get understanding.

**⁸** Exalt her, and she doth lift thee up, She honoureth thee, when thou dost embrace her.

**⁹** She giveth to thy head a wreath of grace, A crown of beauty she doth give thee freely.

**¹⁰** Hear, my son, and receive my sayings, And years of life [are] multiplied to thee.

**¹¹** In a way of wisdom I have directed thee, I have caused thee to tread in paths of uprightness.

**¹²** In thy walking thy step is not straitened, And if thou runnest, thou stumblest not.

**¹³** Lay hold on instruction, do not desist, Keep her, for she [is] thy life.

**¹⁴** Into the path of the wicked enter not, And be not happy in a way of evil doers.

**¹⁵** Avoid it, pass not over into it, Turn aside from it, and pass on.

**¹⁶** For they sleep not if they do not evil, And their sleep hath been taken violently away, If they cause not [some] to stumble.

**¹⁷** For they have eaten bread of wickedness, And wine of violence they drink.

**¹⁸** And the path of the righteous [is] as a shining light, Going and brightening till the day is established,

**¹⁹** The way of the wicked [is] as darkness, They have not known at what they stumble.

**²⁰** My son, to my words give attention, To my sayings incline thine ear,

**²¹** Let them not turn aside from thine eyes, Preserve them in the midst of thy heart.

**²²** For life they [are] to those finding them, And to all their flesh healing.

**²³** Above every charge keep thy heart, For out of it [are] the outgoings of life.

**²⁴** Turn aside from thee a froward mouth, And perverse lips put far from thee,

**²⁵** Thine eyes do look straightforward, And thine eyelids look straight before thee.

**²⁶** Ponder thou the path of thy feet, And all thy ways [are] established.

**²⁷** Incline not [to] the right or to the left, Turn aside thy foot from evil!
