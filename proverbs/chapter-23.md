# Chapter 23

<sup>1</sup> When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, Thou considerest diligently that which [is] before thee,

<sup>2</sup> And thou hast put a knife to thy throat, If thou [art] a man of appetite.

<sup>3</sup> Have no desire to his dainties, seeing it [is] lying food.

<sup>4</sup> Labour not to make wealth, From thine own understanding cease, Dost thou cause thine eyes to fly upon it? Then it is not.

<sup>5</sup> For wealth maketh to itself wings, As an eagle it flieth to the heavens.

<sup>6</sup> Eat not the bread of an evil eye, And have no desire to his dainties,

<sup>7</sup> For as he hath thought in his soul, so [is] he, 'Eat and drink,' saith he to thee, And his heart [is] not with thee.

<sup>8</sup> Thy morsel thou hast eaten thou dost vomit up, And hast marred thy words that [are] sweet.

<sup>9</sup> In the ears of a fool speak not, For he treadeth on the wisdom of thy words.

<sup>10</sup> Remove not a border of olden times, And into fields of the fatherless enter not,

<sup>11</sup> For their Redeemer [is] strong, He doth plead their cause with thee.

<sup>12</sup> Bring in to instruction thy heart, And thine ear to sayings of knowledge.

<sup>13</sup> Withhold not from a youth chastisement, When thou smitest him with a rod he dieth not.

<sup>14</sup> Thou with a rod smitest him, And his soul from Sheol thou deliverest.

<sup>15</sup> My son, if thy heart hath been wise, My heart rejoiceth, even mine,

<sup>16</sup> And my reins exult when thy lips speak uprightly.

<sup>17</sup> Let not thy heart be envious at sinners, But — in the fear of Jehovah all the day.

<sup>18</sup> For, is there a posterity? Then thy hope is not cut off.

<sup>19</sup> Hear thou, my son, and be wise, And make happy in the way thy heart,

<sup>20</sup> Be not thou among quaffers of wine, Among gluttonous ones of flesh,

<sup>21</sup> For the quaffer and glutton become poor, And drowsiness clotheth with rags.

<sup>22</sup> Hearken to thy father, who begat thee, And despise not thy mother when she hath become old.

<sup>23</sup> Truth buy, and sell not, Wisdom, and instruction, and understanding,

<sup>24</sup> The father of the righteous rejoiceth greatly, The begetter of the wise rejoiceth in him.

<sup>25</sup> Rejoice doth thy father and thy mother, Yea, she that bare thee is joyful.

<sup>26</sup> Give, my son, thy heart to me, And let thine eyes watch my ways.

<sup>27</sup> For a harlot [is] a deep ditch, And a strange woman [is] a strait pit.

<sup>28</sup> She also, as catching prey, lieth in wait, And the treacherous among men she increaseth.

<sup>29</sup> Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? Who hath contentions? who hath plaint? Who hath wounds without cause? Who hath redness of eyes?

<sup>30</sup> Those tarrying by the wine, Those going in to search out mixed wine.

<sup>31</sup> See not wine when it showeth itself red, When it giveth in the cup its colour, It goeth up and down through the upright.

<sup>32</sup> Its latter end — as a serpent it biteth, And as a basilisk it stingeth.

<sup>33</sup> Thine eyes see strange women, And thy heart speaketh perverse things.

<sup>34</sup> And thou hast been as one lying down in the heart of the sea, And as one lying down on the top of a mast.

<sup>35</sup> 'They smote me, I have not been sick, They beat me, I have not known. When I awake — I seek it yet again!'
