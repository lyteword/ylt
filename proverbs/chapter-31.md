# Chapter 31

<sup>1</sup> Words of Lemuel a king, a declaration that his mother taught him:

<sup>2</sup> 'What, my son? and what, son of my womb? And what, son of my vows?

<sup>3</sup> Give not to women thy strength, And thy ways to wiping away of kings.

<sup>4</sup> Not for kings, O Lemuel, Not for kings, to drink wine, And for princes a desire of strong drink.

<sup>5</sup> Lest he drink, and forget the decree, And change the judgment of any of the sons of affliction.

<sup>6</sup> Give strong drink to the perishing, And wine to the bitter in soul,

<sup>7</sup> He drinketh, and forgetteth his poverty, And his misery he remembereth not again.

<sup>8</sup> Open thy mouth for the dumb, For the right of all sons of change.

<sup>9</sup> Open thy mouth, judge righteously, Both the cause of the poor and needy!'

<sup>10</sup> A woman of worth who doth find? Yea, far above rubies [is] her price.

<sup>11</sup> The heart of her husband hath trusted in her, And spoil he lacketh not.

<sup>12</sup> She hath done him good, and not evil, All days of her life.

<sup>13</sup> She hath sought wool and flax, And with delight she worketh [with] her hands.

<sup>14</sup> She hath been as ships of the merchant, From afar she bringeth in her bread.

<sup>15</sup> Yea, she riseth while yet night, And giveth food to her household, And a portion to her damsels.

<sup>16</sup> She hath considered a field, and taketh it, From the fruit of her hands she hath planted a vineyard.

<sup>17</sup> She hath girded with might her loins, And doth strengthen her arms.

<sup>18</sup> She hath perceived when her merchandise [is] good, Her lamp is not extinguished in the night.

<sup>19</sup> Her hands she hath sent forth on a spindle, And her hands have held a distaff.

<sup>20</sup> Her hand she hath spread forth to the poor, Yea, her hands she sent forth to the needy.

<sup>21</sup> She is not afraid of her household from snow, For all her household are clothed [with] scarlet.

<sup>22</sup> Ornamental coverings she hath made for herself, Silk and purple [are] her clothing.

<sup>23</sup> Known in the gates is her husband, In his sitting with elders of the land.

<sup>24</sup> Linen garments she hath made, and selleth, And a girdle she hath given to the merchant.

<sup>25</sup> Strength and honour [are] her clothing, And she rejoiceth at a latter day.

<sup>26</sup> Her mouth she hath opened in wisdom, And the law of kindness [is] on her tongue.

<sup>27</sup> She [is] watching the ways of her household, And bread of sloth she eateth not.

<sup>28</sup> Her sons have risen up, and pronounce her happy, Her husband, and he praiseth her,

<sup>29</sup> 'Many [are] the daughters who have done worthily, Thou hast gone up above them all.'

<sup>30</sup> The grace [is] false, and the beauty [is] vain, A woman fearing Jehovah, she may boast herself.

<sup>31</sup> Give ye to her of the fruit of her hands, And her works do praise her in the gates!
