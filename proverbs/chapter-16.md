# Proverbs 16 

**¹** Of man [are] arrangements of the heart, And from Jehovah an answer of the tongue.

**²** All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes, And Jehovah is pondering the spirits.

**³** Roll unto Jehovah thy works, And established are thy purposes,

**⁴** All things hath Jehovah wrought for Himself, And also the wicked [worketh] for a day of evil.

**⁵** An abomination to Jehovah [is] every proud one of heart, Hand to hand he is not acquitted.

**⁶** In kindness and truth pardoned is iniquity, And in the fear of Jehovah Turn thou aside from evil.

**⁷** When a man's ways please Jehovah, even his enemies, He causeth to be at peace with him.

**⁸** Better [is] a little with righteousness, Than abundance of increase without justice.

**⁹** The heart of man deviseth his way, And Jehovah establisheth his step.

**¹⁰** An oath [is] on the lips of a king, In judgment his mouth trespasseth not.

**¹¹** A just beam and balances [are] Jehovah's, His work [are] all the stones of the bag.

**¹²** An abomination to kings [is] doing wickedness, For by righteousness is a throne established.

**¹³** The delight of kings [are] righteous lips, And whoso is speaking uprightly he loveth,

**¹⁴** The fury of a king [is] messengers of death, And a wise man pacifieth it.

**¹⁵** In the light of a king's face [is] life, And his good-will [is] as a cloud of the latter rain.

**¹⁶** To get wisdom — how much better than gold, And to get understanding to be chosen than silver!

**¹⁷** A highway of the upright [is], 'Turn from evil,' Whoso is preserving his soul is watching his way.

**¹⁸** Before destruction [is] pride, And before stumbling — a haughty spirit.'

**¹⁹** Better is humility of spirit with the poor, Than to apportion spoil with the proud.

**²⁰** The wise in any matter findeth good, And whoso is trusting in Jehovah, O his happiness.

**²¹** To the wise in heart is called, 'Intelligent,' And sweetness of lips increaseth learning.

**²²** A fountain of life [is] understanding to its possessors, The instruction of fools is folly.

**²³** The heart of the wise causeth his mouth to act wisely, And by his lips he increaseth learning,

**²⁴** Sayings of pleasantness [are] a honeycomb, Sweet to the soul, and healing to the bone.

**²⁵** There is a way right before a man, And its latter end — ways of death.

**²⁶** A labouring man hath laboured for himself, For his mouth hath caused [him] to bend over it.

**²⁷** A worthless man is preparing evil, And on his lips — as a burning fire.

**²⁸** A froward man sendeth forth contention, A tale-bearer is separating a familiar friend.

**²⁹** A violent man enticeth his neighbour, And hath causeth him to go in a way not good.

**³⁰** Consulting his eyes to devise froward things, Moving his lips he hath accomplished evil.

**³¹** A crown of beauty [are] grey hairs, In the way of righteousness it is found.

**³²** Better [is] the slow to anger than the mighty, And the ruler over his spirit than he who is taking a city.

**³³** Into the centre is the lot cast, And from Jehovah [is] all its judgment!
