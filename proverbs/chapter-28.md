# Chapter 28

<sup>1</sup> The wicked have fled and there is no pursuer. And the righteous as a young lion is confident.

<sup>2</sup> By the transgression of a land many [are] its heads. And by an intelligent man, Who knoweth right — it is prolonged.

<sup>3</sup> A man — poor and oppressing the weak, [Is] a sweeping rain, and there is no bread.

<sup>4</sup> Those forsaking the law praise the wicked, Those keeping the law plead against them.

<sup>5</sup> Evil men understand not judgment, And those seeking Jehovah understand all.

<sup>6</sup> Better [is] the poor walking in his integrity, Than the perverse of ways who is rich.

<sup>7</sup> Whoso is keeping the law is an intelligent son, And a friend of gluttons, Doth cause his father to blush.

<sup>8</sup> Whoso is multiplying his wealth by biting and usury, For one favouring the poor doth gather it.

<sup>9</sup> Whoso is turning his ear from hearing the law, Even his prayer [is] an abomination.

<sup>10</sup> Whoso is causing the upright to err in an evil way, Into his own pit he doth fall, And the perfect do inherit good.

<sup>11</sup> A rich man is wise in his own eyes, And the intelligent poor searcheth him.

<sup>12</sup> In the exulting of the righteous the glory [is] abundant, And in the rising of the wicked man is apprehensive.

<sup>13</sup> Whoso is covering his transgressions prospereth not, And he who is confessing and forsaking hath mercy.

<sup>14</sup> O the happiness of a man fearing continually, And whoso is hardening his heart falleth into evil.

<sup>15</sup> A growling lion, and a ranging bear, [Is] the wicked ruler over a poor people.

<sup>16</sup> A leader lacking understanding multiplieth oppressions, Whoso is hating dishonest gain prolongeth days.

<sup>17</sup> A man oppressed with the blood of a soul, Unto the pit fleeth, none taketh hold on him.

<sup>18</sup> Whoso is walking uprightly is saved, And the perverted of ways falleth at once.

<sup>19</sup> Whoso is tilling his ground is satisfied [with] bread, And whoso is pursuing vanity, Is filled [with] poverty.

<sup>20</sup> A stedfast man hath multiplied blessings, And whoso is hasting to be rich is not acquitted.

<sup>21</sup> To discern faces is not good, And for a piece of bread doth a man transgress.

<sup>22</sup> Troubled for wealth [is] the man [with] an evil eye, And he knoweth not that want doth meet him.

<sup>23</sup> Whoso is reproving a man afterwards findeth grace, More than a flatterer with the tongue.

<sup>24</sup> Whoso is robbing his father, or his mother, And is saying, 'It is not transgression,' A companion he is to a destroyer.

<sup>25</sup> Whoso is proud in soul stirreth up contention, And whoso is trusting on Jehovah is made fat.

<sup>26</sup> Whoso is trusting in his heart is a fool, And whoso is walking in wisdom is delivered.

<sup>27</sup> Whoso is giving to the poor hath no lack, And whoso is hiding his eyes multiplied curses.

<sup>28</sup> In the rising of the wicked a man is hidden, And in their destruction the righteous multiply!
