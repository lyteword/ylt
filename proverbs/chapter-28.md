# Chapter 28

**¹** The wicked have fled and there is no pursuer. And the righteous as a young lion is confident.

**²** By the transgression of a land many [are] its heads. And by an intelligent man, Who knoweth right — it is prolonged.

**³** A man — poor and oppressing the weak, [Is] a sweeping rain, and there is no bread.

**⁴** Those forsaking the law praise the wicked, Those keeping the law plead against them.

**⁵** Evil men understand not judgment, And those seeking Jehovah understand all.

**⁶** Better [is] the poor walking in his integrity, Than the perverse of ways who is rich.

**⁷** Whoso is keeping the law is an intelligent son, And a friend of gluttons, Doth cause his father to blush.

**⁸** Whoso is multiplying his wealth by biting and usury, For one favouring the poor doth gather it.

**⁹** Whoso is turning his ear from hearing the law, Even his prayer [is] an abomination.

**¹⁰** Whoso is causing the upright to err in an evil way, Into his own pit he doth fall, And the perfect do inherit good.

**¹¹** A rich man is wise in his own eyes, And the intelligent poor searcheth him.

**¹²** In the exulting of the righteous the glory [is] abundant, And in the rising of the wicked man is apprehensive.

**¹³** Whoso is covering his transgressions prospereth not, And he who is confessing and forsaking hath mercy.

**¹⁴** O the happiness of a man fearing continually, And whoso is hardening his heart falleth into evil.

**¹⁵** A growling lion, and a ranging bear, [Is] the wicked ruler over a poor people.

**¹⁶** A leader lacking understanding multiplieth oppressions, Whoso is hating dishonest gain prolongeth days.

**¹⁷** A man oppressed with the blood of a soul, Unto the pit fleeth, none taketh hold on him.

**¹⁸** Whoso is walking uprightly is saved, And the perverted of ways falleth at once.

**¹⁹** Whoso is tilling his ground is satisfied [with] bread, And whoso is pursuing vanity, Is filled [with] poverty.

**²⁰** A stedfast man hath multiplied blessings, And whoso is hasting to be rich is not acquitted.

**²¹** To discern faces is not good, And for a piece of bread doth a man transgress.

**²²** Troubled for wealth [is] the man [with] an evil eye, And he knoweth not that want doth meet him.

**²³** Whoso is reproving a man afterwards findeth grace, More than a flatterer with the tongue.

**²⁴** Whoso is robbing his father, or his mother, And is saying, 'It is not transgression,' A companion he is to a destroyer.

**²⁵** Whoso is proud in soul stirreth up contention, And whoso is trusting on Jehovah is made fat.

**²⁶** Whoso is trusting in his heart is a fool, And whoso is walking in wisdom is delivered.

**²⁷** Whoso is giving to the poor hath no lack, And whoso is hiding his eyes multiplied curses.

**²⁸** In the rising of the wicked a man is hidden, And in their destruction the righteous multiply!
