# Chapter 10

<sup>1</sup> Proverbs of Solomon. A wise son causeth a father to rejoice, And a foolish son [is] an affliction to his mother.

<sup>2</sup> Treasures of wickedness profit not, And righteousness delivereth from death.

<sup>3</sup> Jehovah causeth not the soul of the righteous to hunger, And the desire of the wicked He thrusteth away.

<sup>4</sup> Poor [is] he who is working — a slothful hand, And the hand of the diligent maketh rich.

<sup>5</sup> Whoso is gathering in summer [is] a wise son, Whoso is sleeping in harvest [is] a son causing shame.

<sup>6</sup> Blessings [are] for the head of the righteous, And the mouth of the wicked cover doth violence.

<sup>7</sup> The remembrance of the righteous [is] for a blessing, And the name of the wicked doth rot.

<sup>8</sup> The wise in heart accepteth commands, And a talkative fool kicketh.

<sup>9</sup> Whoso is walking in integrity walketh confidently, And whoso is perverting his ways is known.

<sup>10</sup> Whoso is winking the eye giveth grief, And a talkative fool kicketh.

<sup>11</sup> A fountain of life [is] the mouth of the righteous, And the mouth of the wicked cover doth violence.

<sup>12</sup> Hatred awaketh contentions, And over all transgressions love covereth.

<sup>13</sup> In the lips of the intelligent is wisdom found, And a rod [is] for the back of him who is lacking understanding.

<sup>14</sup> The wise lay up knowledge, and the mouth of a fool [is] near ruin.

<sup>15</sup> The wealth of the rich [is] his strong city, The ruin of the poor [is] their poverty.

<sup>16</sup> The wage of the righteous [is] for life, The increase of the wicked for sin.

<sup>17</sup> A traveller to life [is] he who is keeping instruction, And whoso is forsaking rebuke is erring.

<sup>18</sup> Whoso is covering hatred with lying lips, And whoso is bringing out an evil report is a fool.

<sup>19</sup> In the abundance of words transgression ceaseth not, And whoso is restraining his lips [is] wise.

<sup>20</sup> The tongue of the righteous [is] chosen silver, The heart of the wicked — as a little thing.

<sup>21</sup> The lips of the righteous delight many, And fools for lack of heart die.

<sup>22</sup> The blessing of Jehovah — it maketh rich, And He addeth no grief with it.

<sup>23</sup> To execute inventions [is] as play to a fool, And wisdom to a man of understanding.

<sup>24</sup> The feared thing of the wicked it meeteth him, And the desire of the righteous is given.

<sup>25</sup> As the passing by of a hurricane, So the wicked is not, And the righteous is a foundation age-during.

<sup>26</sup> As vinegar to the teeth, And as smoke to the eyes, So [is] the slothful to those sending him.

<sup>27</sup> The fear of Jehovah addeth days, And the years of the wicked are shortened.

<sup>28</sup> The hope of the righteous [is] joyful, And the expectation of the wicked perisheth.

<sup>29</sup> The way of Jehovah [is] strength to the perfect, And ruin to workers of iniquity.

<sup>30</sup> The righteous to the age is not moved, And the wicked inhabit not the earth.

<sup>31</sup> The mouth of the righteous uttereth wisdom, And the tongue of frowardness is cut out.

<sup>32</sup> The lips of the righteous know a pleasing thing, And the mouth of the wicked perverseness!
