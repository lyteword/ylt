# Chapter 10

**¹** Proverbs of Solomon. A wise son causeth a father to rejoice, And a foolish son [is] an affliction to his mother.

**²** Treasures of wickedness profit not, And righteousness delivereth from death.

**³** Jehovah causeth not the soul of the righteous to hunger, And the desire of the wicked He thrusteth away.

**⁴** Poor [is] he who is working — a slothful hand, And the hand of the diligent maketh rich.

**⁵** Whoso is gathering in summer [is] a wise son, Whoso is sleeping in harvest [is] a son causing shame.

**⁶** Blessings [are] for the head of the righteous, And the mouth of the wicked cover doth violence.

**⁷** The remembrance of the righteous [is] for a blessing, And the name of the wicked doth rot.

**⁸** The wise in heart accepteth commands, And a talkative fool kicketh.

**⁹** Whoso is walking in integrity walketh confidently, And whoso is perverting his ways is known.

**¹⁰** Whoso is winking the eye giveth grief, And a talkative fool kicketh.

**¹¹** A fountain of life [is] the mouth of the righteous, And the mouth of the wicked cover doth violence.

**¹²** Hatred awaketh contentions, And over all transgressions love covereth.

**¹³** In the lips of the intelligent is wisdom found, And a rod [is] for the back of him who is lacking understanding.

**¹⁴** The wise lay up knowledge, and the mouth of a fool [is] near ruin.

**¹⁵** The wealth of the rich [is] his strong city, The ruin of the poor [is] their poverty.

**¹⁶** The wage of the righteous [is] for life, The increase of the wicked for sin.

**¹⁷** A traveller to life [is] he who is keeping instruction, And whoso is forsaking rebuke is erring.

**¹⁸** Whoso is covering hatred with lying lips, And whoso is bringing out an evil report is a fool.

**¹⁹** In the abundance of words transgression ceaseth not, And whoso is restraining his lips [is] wise.

**²⁰** The tongue of the righteous [is] chosen silver, The heart of the wicked — as a little thing.

**²¹** The lips of the righteous delight many, And fools for lack of heart die.

**²²** The blessing of Jehovah — it maketh rich, And He addeth no grief with it.

**²³** To execute inventions [is] as play to a fool, And wisdom to a man of understanding.

**²⁴** The feared thing of the wicked it meeteth him, And the desire of the righteous is given.

**²⁵** As the passing by of a hurricane, So the wicked is not, And the righteous is a foundation age-during.

**²⁶** As vinegar to the teeth, And as smoke to the eyes, So [is] the slothful to those sending him.

**²⁷** The fear of Jehovah addeth days, And the years of the wicked are shortened.

**²⁸** The hope of the righteous [is] joyful, And the expectation of the wicked perisheth.

**²⁹** The way of Jehovah [is] strength to the perfect, And ruin to workers of iniquity.

**³⁰** The righteous to the age is not moved, And the wicked inhabit not the earth.

**³¹** The mouth of the righteous uttereth wisdom, And the tongue of frowardness is cut out.

**³²** The lips of the righteous know a pleasing thing, And the mouth of the wicked perverseness!
