# Chapter 3

<sup>1</sup> For this cause, I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you the nations,

<sup>2</sup> if, indeed, ye did hear of the dispensation of the grace of God that was given to me in regard to you,

<sup>3</sup> that by revelation He made known to me the secret, according as I wrote before in few [words] —

<sup>4</sup> in regard to which ye are able, reading [it], to understand my knowledge in the secret of the Christ,

<sup>5</sup> which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it was now revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit —

<sup>6</sup> that the nations be fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of His promise in the Christ, through the good news,

<sup>7</sup> of which I became a ministrant, according to the gift of the grace of God that was given to me, according to the working of His power;

<sup>8</sup> to me — the less than the least of all the saints — was given this grace, among the nations to proclaim good news — the untraceable riches of the Christ,

<sup>9</sup> and to cause all to see what [is] the fellowship of the secret that hath been hid from the ages in God, who the all things did create by Jesus Christ,

<sup>10</sup> that there might be made known now to the principalities and the authorities in the heavenly [places], through the assembly, the manifold wisdom of God,

<sup>11</sup> according to a purpose of the ages, which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord,

<sup>12</sup> in whom we have the freedom and the access in confidence through the faith of him,

<sup>13</sup> wherefore, I ask [you] not to faint in my tribulations for you, which is your glory.

<sup>14</sup> For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

<sup>15</sup> of whom the whole family in the heavens and on earth is named,

<sup>16</sup> that He may give to you, according to the riches of His glory, with might to be strengthened through His Spirit, in regard to the inner man,

<sup>17</sup> that the Christ may dwell through the faith in your hearts, in love having been rooted and founded,

<sup>18</sup> that ye may be in strength to comprehend, with all the saints, what [is] the breadth, and length, and depth, and height,

<sup>19</sup> to know also the love of the Christ that is exceeding the knowledge, that ye may be filled — to all the fulness of God;

<sup>20</sup> and to Him who is able above all things to do exceeding abundantly what we ask or think, according to the power that is working in us,

<sup>21</sup> to Him [is] the glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus, to all the generations of the age of the ages. Amen.
