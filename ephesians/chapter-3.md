# Ephesians 3 

**¹** For this cause, I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you the nations,

**²** if, indeed, ye did hear of the dispensation of the grace of God that was given to me in regard to you,

**³** that by revelation He made known to me the secret, according as I wrote before in few [words] —

**⁴** in regard to which ye are able, reading [it], to understand my knowledge in the secret of the Christ,

**⁵** which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it was now revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit —

**⁶** that the nations be fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of His promise in the Christ, through the good news,

**⁷** of which I became a ministrant, according to the gift of the grace of God that was given to me, according to the working of His power;

**⁸** to me — the less than the least of all the saints — was given this grace, among the nations to proclaim good news — the untraceable riches of the Christ,

**⁹** and to cause all to see what [is] the fellowship of the secret that hath been hid from the ages in God, who the all things did create by Jesus Christ,

**¹⁰** that there might be made known now to the principalities and the authorities in the heavenly [places], through the assembly, the manifold wisdom of God,

**¹¹** according to a purpose of the ages, which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord,

**¹²** in whom we have the freedom and the access in confidence through the faith of him,

**¹³** wherefore, I ask [you] not to faint in my tribulations for you, which is your glory.

**¹⁴** For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

**¹⁵** of whom the whole family in the heavens and on earth is named,

**¹⁶** that He may give to you, according to the riches of His glory, with might to be strengthened through His Spirit, in regard to the inner man,

**¹⁷** that the Christ may dwell through the faith in your hearts, in love having been rooted and founded,

**¹⁸** that ye may be in strength to comprehend, with all the saints, what [is] the breadth, and length, and depth, and height,

**¹⁹** to know also the love of the Christ that is exceeding the knowledge, that ye may be filled — to all the fulness of God;

**²⁰** and to Him who is able above all things to do exceeding abundantly what we ask or think, according to the power that is working in us,

**²¹** to Him [is] the glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus, to all the generations of the age of the ages. Amen.
