# Chapter 5

<sup>1</sup> Become, then, followers of God, as children beloved,

<sup>2</sup> and walk in love, as also the Christ did love us, and did give himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odour of a sweet smell,

<sup>3</sup> and whoredom, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints;

<sup>4</sup> also filthiness, and foolish talking, or jesting, — the things not fit — but rather thanksgiving;

<sup>5</sup> for this ye know, that every whoremonger, or unclean, or covetous person, who is an idolater, hath no inheritance in the reign of the Christ and God.

<sup>6</sup> Let no one deceive you with vain words, for because of these things cometh the anger of God upon the sons of the disobedience,

<sup>7</sup> become not, then, partakers with them,

<sup>8</sup> for ye were once darkness, and now light in the Lord; as children of light walk ye,

<sup>9</sup> for the fruit of the Spirit [is] in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth,

<sup>10</sup> proving what is well-pleasing to the Lord,

<sup>11</sup> and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of the darkness and rather even convict,

<sup>12</sup> for the things in secret done by them it is a shame even to speak of,

<sup>13</sup> and all the things reproved by the light are manifested, for everything that is manifested is light;

<sup>14</sup> wherefore he saith, 'Arouse thyself, thou who art sleeping, and arise out of the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee.'

<sup>15</sup> See, then, how exactly ye walk, not as unwise, but as wise,

<sup>16</sup> redeeming the time, because the days are evil;

<sup>17</sup> because of this become not fools, but — understanding what [is] the will of the Lord,

<sup>18</sup> and be not drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in the Spirit,

<sup>19</sup> speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord,

<sup>20</sup> giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the God and Father;

<sup>21</sup> subjecting yourselves to one another in the fear of God.

<sup>22</sup> The wives! to your own husbands subject yourselves, as to the Lord,

<sup>23</sup> because the husband is head of the wife, as also the Christ [is] head of the assembly, and he is saviour of the body,

<sup>24</sup> but even as the assembly is subject to Christ, so also [are] the wives to their own husbands in everything.

<sup>25</sup> The husbands! love your own wives, as also the Christ did love the assembly, and did give himself for it,

<sup>26</sup> that he might sanctify it, having cleansed [it] with the bathing of the water in the saying,

<sup>27</sup> that he might present it to himself the assembly in glory, not having spot or wrinkle, or any of such things, but that it may be holy and unblemished;

<sup>28</sup> so ought the husbands to love their own wives as their own bodies: he who is loving his own wife — himself he doth love;

<sup>29</sup> for no one ever his own flesh did hate, but doth nourish and cherish it, as also the Lord — the assembly,

<sup>30</sup> because members we are of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones;

<sup>31</sup> 'for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and they shall be — the two — for one flesh;'

<sup>32</sup> this secret is great, and I speak in regard to Christ and to the assembly;

<sup>33</sup> but ye also, every one in particular — let each his own wife so love as himself, and the wife — that she may reverence the husband.
